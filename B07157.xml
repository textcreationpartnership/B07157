            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:191458:4"/> comforted himſelfe, going down into the body of the ſhip (where the day before that great aſſemblie had ben) but he found no man; and ſéeking further, hee went into the chappel, where hee eſpied <hi>Sergil</hi> his ſquire faſt ſléeping, and hard by him two old men with rols on their heads, apparrelled like Turkes: with that he went to <hi>Sergil,</hi> and with his foot gaue him ſuch a thruſt, that on a ſodain he ſtarted vp, and ſpeaking to his maiſter (as though hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſéene him before) aſked him what he meant, whereat <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> began to laugh, and ſaid vnto him: Good God, <hi>Sergil,</hi> haſt thou ben in my company all thy life time, and knoweſt mee no better? and taking him by the hand, he drew him in ſuch maner to him that therewith hee awaked, much aſhamed to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch a fault: whereof ſéeking to excuſe himſelfe, hee ſaid vnto his maiſter, By my faith ſir, I was ſo faſt aſléepe when you called me, that I neither remembred you nor my ſelfe, and I am now more abaſhed then I was before to think how I fel into ſo ſound a ſléepe: That cannot I tel (anſwered <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) although as much hath happened vnto me. Then he told him that hee had ſlept, and when he awaked he found himſelfe alone betwéene the wings of the Serpent, without any of the company that were with him when hee receiued the order of knighthood, and now (ſaid he) we are arriued at the foot of the higheſt rocke that euer I ſaw, and withall it is ſo hard and difficult to climbe vp, that I can find neither path nor way how to doe it, yet haue I beheld it long, but (as I perceiue) it is enuironned with the ſea in ſuch manner, that conſidering the ſcituation of the place, I certainly beléeue it is the rocke of the Enchauntreſſe, whereof in times paſt thou haſt heard by <hi>Amadis</hi> my father. And as they were in this manner ſpeaking, <hi>Sergil</hi> heard the two old men ſnort (that as yet they had not once perceiued) and demanded of <hi>Eſplandian</hi> if he knew them not: As God helpe me no (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) for as farre as I remember I neuer ſaw them before, but I iudge that <hi>Vrganda</hi> hath left them here to helpe vs if we néed. I pray you ſaid <hi>Sergil</hi> let vs awake them: then hee called them ſo lowd that they roſe vp, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> aſking them who brought them thether, but they made ſignes that they could not ſpeake. It was then
<pb facs="tcp:191458:4"/> about twelue of the clocke, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> would willingly haue eaten if he had found meat, and ſaid vnto <hi>Sergil,</hi> Friend, neuer in all my life had I ſo good an appetite to eat as I haue now, but I doubt we ſhall find no victuals in the ſhip, I pray thée <hi>Sergil</hi> let vs go ſée, for as I perceiue, if we truſt vnto theſe dumbe men, we are like to fare but hardly: but the dumbe men perceiued well what he meant: wherefore going out of the chappell they entred into a chamber that ioined to the hall, from whence they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, bringing with them ſuch quantity of meate that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplandian</hi> and <hi>Sergil</hi> were neuer better ſatiſfied in all their liues: hauing dined &amp; the tables vncouered, they went vnto the place where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had ſlept, from whence hee ſhewed <hi>Sergil</hi> the rocke whereof hee had told him before, ſaying: Aſſure thy ſelfe <hi>Sergil,</hi> ſéeing the ſerpent ſtirreth not from hence, it is a ſigne that I muſt goe vpon this high rock to ſée if there be any aduentures, and if I can bring them to an end I know not (anſwered <hi>Sergil</hi>) what you will doe, but if you truſt to the coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:191458:5"/> man is ouercome, not for want of courage or ſtomacke to reſiſt, but for want of weapons to defend himſelfe, and with that hee went backe vnto the boat, and bringing one of the oares with him, gaue it to his maiſter, in which maner they began to mount vpon the rocke not without great paine, the way being ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, the aire hote, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> heauily armed.

Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> put off his helmet, and laying downe his ſhield, eate ſuch meate as his Squire had brought with him: which done, lying downe vpon the graſſe he ſlept till the morning that he and <hi>Sergil</hi> entered into the chappell, where they beheld the image and the writing, but neither of them could read it becauſe the letters were in Gréek, which they vnderſtood not. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> determining to goe further, ſaid to <hi>Sergil,</hi> Friend, it is beſt for you to ſtay here till I come againe, for if this be the rocke where my father &amp; <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> (whether it weare by fortune or willingly) did once arriue, I remember I haue heard them tell, that in Summer the aire is ſo whote therein that it bréedeth many venomous beaſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mighteſt receiue ſome harme, being no better armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art, but as for mee thou knoweſt I am predeſtined to thoſe aduentures that other men haue failed to accompliſh, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me in hope either that I ſhall not liue long, or I ſhal accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the things that are foreſhewed of me, and by that meanes ſhall conquer the ſword and the treaſure, that for certaine is ſaid to be in an old pallace within this rocke. What, ſaid <hi>Sergil,</hi> Doe you think that although I ſhould die a thouſand deaths I would refuſe to goe with you? No by my faith, for I know that without your company life wil be irkſomer to me then a thouſand deaths if a man could indure ſo many. Friend anſwered <hi>Eſplandian</hi> I beléeue it wel, neuertheleſſe if any inconuenience ſhould happen vnto thée, beſides the blame I might receiue thereby, thy deede

Wherewith <hi>Sergil</hi> perceiuing no remedy, turned his head aſide and began to wéepe. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean time <hi>Eſplandian</hi> laced on his helmet, and hanging his ſhield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke with the oare on his ſhoulder, kept on the pathes that at the laſt brought him to the top of the rocke, and being there hee went towards the broken caſtle, where hee perceiued the other Image with the table that ſhe held in her left hand, the contents whereof he could no more vnderſtand then that of the Hermitage, wherfore without longer ſtaying he paſſed forward towards the chamber where the treaſure lay, being continually guarded by a moſt great and horrible ſerpent: and as hee went néerer to it, he perceiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates to be of hard ſtone, where there was a ſword ſo farre thruſt in, that nothing but the handle could be ſéene, wherewith he thought it to be the ſame whereof he had heard, and being moued with great deſire to haue it, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (although he had but a ſtaffe to defend himſelfe) to aſſaile the beaſt, whatſoeuer happened thereby. And to the ſame end with a bold courage he ſet forwards, but the ſerpent (that as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlept) awaked, and looking with a cruell countenance vpon <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> began to hiſſe, and caſt out fire at he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then the dumbe man ſhewed him a path that led him vp to the rocke, and made him a ſigne to goe thether, where with he iſſued out of the barke, armed at all points, and began to mount vp, the weather was then extreame hote, whereby the knight was ſo chaſed in his harneſs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was conſtrained to put off his helmet &amp; carry it in his hand, till he perceiued a little Hermitage among the buſhes, &amp; before it ſtood a high croſſe, which pleaſed him well, not only for the hope he had to find ſome one of whom hee might enquire in what countrey hee was, but becauſe hee was aſſured that there dwelt a Chriſtian, and with that hée perceiued a man apparrelled like an Hermite, ſo old and withered that his long white beard hung downe to his girdle, carrying in his hand a pitcher of water, that he had drawne out of a fountaine not farre from thence, and was paſſing by when the knight ſpake vnto him, ſaying: Father, God ſaue you, which when the good man heard, he was in ſo great a maſe, that for feare his pitcher fell out of his hand and brake in péeces. Neuertheleſſe by little and little
<pb facs="tcp:191458:8"/> he came to himſelfe againe, and perceiuing him that ſpake vnto him, anſwered and ſaid, My ſonne, it is now twenty years paſt fithence I left the pleaſures of this world, and forſeek my natiue ſoile to obtaine the grace of God, and that which moſt abaſheth mée is, that ſince the time whereof I ſpeake I neuer found man that as yet ſaluted mee in this manner, and I thinke verely you are a ſtranger in theſe countries, or els your ſpéech and apparell diſguiſeth you much. Father (ſaid the knight) true it is I am a ſtranger, brought hether by ſuch meanes, that I neither know the country where I am, nor any man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inhabiting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for you are the firſt creature that I met ſince I arriued here, of whom I might enquire, aſſuring you that when I perceiued this croſſe it reioiced my heart, for it is the armes of the maiſter that I ſerue. What ſaied the Hermit, doe you then know the vertue thereof? I, anſwered the knight, that I doe, being well aſſured that vpon the like croſſe our Redéemer (whereof I ſpeak) ſuffered death and paſſion. Alas ſaied the holy man, you ſay true, praiſed be his holy name, that once before I die he hath giuen me the grace to let me ſée a man on this ſide the ſea that beléeueth in him, aſſuring you ſir knight that you and I are onely the two creatures in this country that are Chriſtians, for all the reſtare Pagans and idolaters. And as he would haue procéeded further, his ſpéech failed him, doubting that hee to whom hee ſpake, was but a fantaſie or ſhadow of a man, but at the laſt he waxt bolder, and in maner of coniuration aſked him if he were a mortall man or not? Mortall (anſwered the knight) that I am for certain, and withall a ſinner, which diſpleaſeth mee much, and if it abaſheth you at this preſent to ſée mee here, I am my ſelfe no leſſe abaſhed to ſée you: for without doubt the manner of my arriuall in this countrey hath béen ſuch and ſo ſtrange, that I can render you no reaſon thereof, but if you know the countrey where in wée are, I beſéech you good Father tell it me to put me out of doubt. Gladly (ſaid the Hermite) and with that he tooke him by the hand, &amp; led him to his Hermitage, and there ſitting downe together vpon a log of wood, the old man began to ſpeake in this maner, and ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:8"/> Now ſir knight, tell mee I pray you what countryman you are, Father (ſaid he) Great Brittaine is the countrey where in my youth I was borne and bred, I know not if euer you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith: How long is it ſaid the Hermite ſince you came from thence? It is fiftéene daies &amp; more ſince I was there ſaid the knight, did you neuer know king <hi>Liſuart</hi> (ſaied the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite) that in my time raigned therin? Yes truly (ſaid the knight) for I haue ſéene him many times: how did hee when you came from thence ſaid the Hermite? That can I not certainely ſhew ſaid the knight, for hée was loſt and led away from thence, but by whom or in what manner no man cantell, notwithſtanding the great paine and diligence diuers of his knights haue vſed to find him out. When the Hermite heard that, he ſéemed very penſiue, which the knight perceiuing, thought in his mind that hee could tell him ſome newes, where vpon he began to behold him well in the face to ſée if hée changed colour, with that the Hermite (that well perceiued the Knights meaning) ſaid vnto him. Truly Sir Knight, not without cauſe haue I enquired ſo much touching King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> but before I will ſhew you my reaſon why, you ſhal vnderſtand that I am of great Brittaine as well as you, where as yet the greateſt part of my kindred are liuing, whome I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke at the ſame time that a Gyant lord of this country married with a lady who as then I ſerued, and with her paſſed the ſea, not only hoping to reape ſome reward for my former ſeruice, but (as yong men are moued) with a great deſire to ſée ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but it fortuned, that my miſtreſſe being forſaken of God, as ſoone as ſhee arriued in this countrey, left his holy law to receiue the law of her huſband, wherefore conſidering with my ſelf, that by reaſon as wel of my natural weakeneſſe, as by often frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the company of theſe countrymen I might fal into ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I determined to withdraw my ſelfe into this place, wherein I haue endured much paine and miſery, to the great daunger of my life, by reaſon of the controuerſie betwéene the law of Ieſus Chriſt, which I hold, and the law of the Pagans that ſéeke daily to deſtroy it, that without the fauour of my miſtreſſe that would not ſuffer them to diſpleaſe me, I had not liued ſo long as I haue
<pb facs="tcp:191458:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> done among them, but when it pleaſeth God I wil depart hence, and returne again into mine own country, now you haue heard how I haue hetherto liued, I pray you ſir knight (ſaid hee) ſhew mee your aduentures, and who hath brought you into this place from whence very hardly you will euer be able to returne again, but rather are in danger of moſt cruell death, or to indure the moſt horrible impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that euer was heard of, which would gréeue me much, not only for the great beauty and young yeares that I perceiue to be in you, but for that you are my natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman.

Sonne (ſaid the Hermit) you ſhall vnderſtand that a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mine, ſeruant to the lady whereof I ſpake, not long ſince came hether to ſée me, and told mee that hee miſtreſſe returning from great Brittaine, whether ſhee went to deliuer a brother of hers out of priſon, brought with her very ſecretly a knight of great eſtimation as ſhee ſaid, neuertheleſſe I cannot aſſure you who it is: but as I haue learned ſince, they ſay the two Giants ſonnes were much pleaſed therewith, which maketh mee doubt, conſidering the newes you haue ſhewed mee touching king <hi>Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi> that he is moſt likely to be the man, for ſhée is ſo well ſéene in the art of Nigromancy and Magicke, that oftentimes ſhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth miſchief vnto thoſe that neuer offended her.

You are betwéene the marches of Turky and Gréece ſaid the Hermite, for this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine parteth both the countries, but it is ſo ſtrong, not onely by nature, but by art, that neither of the two Princes of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, what force ſoeuer they brought hether, could neuer win it.

Aboue vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rock (ſaid the Hermite) in a caſtle which he hath moſt ſtrongly fortefied, and is kept with all diligence and care by a Giant one of his brethren, with others, of as good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as themſelues, and which is more, it is not poſſible to come néer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtle, but by a little path way whereon the ſea continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beateth, at the end whereof there is a pair of ſtaires cut out of the rocke, whereby you mount vp till you come to an yron gate, where a villaine, in whom the lord of the caſtle putteth his truſt, watcheth continually, for there is no other entery, but onely the great gate that is defended with ſtrong platformes and great Towers, in the middle whereof there is a dore ſo ſtraight, that a man on horſebacke can hardly enter therein, and that way moſt commonly thoſe of the caſtle doe vſe to iſſue forth. Before it bee night ſaid the knight, I meane to ſée what manner of place it is, &amp; if I can I will know who it is, that was ſo lately brought the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God kéepe you from thence (ſaied the Hermite) for thereby you will either procure your owne death, or at the leaſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all impriſonment. Happen what may (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight) I wil proue what fortune it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend mee. That were but ill done of you (ſaid the Hermite) for that men are bound to imploy their forces only in things that ſtand with reaſon and poſſibilitie thereby to reap a benefit by their labors, otherwiſe they are to be eſtéemed deſperat fools, &amp; not valiant &amp; hardy knights adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turing (without due reſpect) not only their bodies, but their ſouls which are of greater price, and Chriſt himſelfe hath by example plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed it vnto vs, for when the Deuil came and tempted him, bidding him doe certain things, which in déed (as he was Chriſt) were poſſible, but as be was man were impoſſible to doe, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him that hee ſhould not tempt the Lord his God. So my good ſonne (ſaid hee) I would aduiſe you to deſiſt from ſo vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable an enterpriſe. You may preach what you will to perſuade me to the contrary (ſaid the knight) but I muſt do that where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I am called, which is to prooue my ſelfe in thoſe aduentures that in mans iudgement ſéeme impoſſible: otherwiſe thoſe that haue foreſhewed of me, ſhould not onely haue trauelled in vaine, but bee eſtéemed liers and fooles. If then their ſayings bee true,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:10"/> what greater honour can I obtain then bringing moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aduentures to an end, I may from henceforth therby reſtrain the rage and fury of ſuch men as hurt, and do iniury vnto others, contrary to the laws of God and man? And if they be found liers I had rather they ſhold be reproued for their want of knowledge then I accuſed of any point of cowardiſe. And if the worſt fal out I will imploy my force againſt ſuch accurſed people, (members and miniſters of the deuill) whom by the help of God I ſhal ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: and I beléeue and am certainely perſuaded (that if I die in thoſe aduentures) hee will receiue my ſoule into his heauenly ioy.

I haue dealt with them (ſaid hee) as it hath pleaſed God to diſpoſe? And how is that (ſaied they) to ſend them both (ſaied the knight) an vnhappy end of their wretched liues, that their ſoules might bee tormented in the euerlaſting paines of hell. With that they looked in and perceiued <hi>Argantes</hi> on the one ſide, and the Giant on the other as yet ſhaking their legs with the panges of death: whereat they had ſo great feare, that in great haſt they preſently retired, crying with a lowd voice, Come foorth my lords, come forth; for your vncle and the Porter are both ſlaine, wherewith at the gate of the dungeon there appeared another Giant vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, very yoong and of a huge ſtature, named <hi>Frerion,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the blacke knight marching ſo boldly towards him, held the dore half ſhut, and with a loud voice ſpake vnto him and ſaid, By my fathers ſoule thou muſt ſurely be ſome deuill diſguiſed in humane ſhape, otherwiſe it had beene vnpoſſible for thée to haue ſlaien two of the beſt knights in the world, and in deſpight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enter thus farre within the caſtle, but of one thing am I well aſſured, that what paine or torment ſoeuer I ſhall cauſe thée to indure, I cannot bee reuenged of the leaſt wrong and iniury I haue receiued at thy handes.

Then ſtay (ſaid <hi>Frerion</hi>) and thou ſhalt ſée how I will teach thée to preach in other ſort, and with that hee ſhut the dore and went in to arme him, meane time the blacke knight ſate downe vpon a marble ſtone, and he had not reſted long, but the Gyant came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who bringing a great cimitere vpon his ſhoulder, would haue iſſued at the gate, when the knight ſpake vnto him, ſaying. Stay a little I pray thée before thou commeſt foorth, and graunt me one requeſt which in right thou canſt not well deny mee, for although neither courteſie nor any part thereof did euer lodge within thy breaſt, that habite of knighthood wherewith thou art inueſted, ought more to mooue thée to humanity then thy nature of it ſelfe affordeth. Aſke what thou wilt (ſaied the Giant) and it may be thou ſhalt be refuſed, both thou and I (ſaid the knight) are now on foote, I pray thée then let vs fight in the other court, that thoſe of thy caſtle may behold the paſtime: which hee ſaied to the end that if he ouercame his enemie as he doubted not therof, they ſhould not ſhut him out. By my head (ſaid the Giant) at the firſt, I thought thou wouldeſt haue aſked mercy at my handes, which would not much auaile thée: but ſéeing thy requeſt is no other, I am content to graunt it, although a meanes to flie away were much more aduantage vnto thée, which theſe high wals will not permit thée, if thou be once incloſed within them.

When the old lady perceiued him ſo farre within the chamber without let, and that he deſired to ſée the king, ſhe being as it were out of her wits, cried as lowd as ſhe could, and ſaied, alas vnhappy wretch that I am, what haue I done, for thinking to reuenge another mans death, I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the deſtruction of mine owne children, and therewith ſhee ſighed in ſuch manner as if her heart would burſt within her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and lamenting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abſence of her other ſon, ſaid: Alas <hi>Matroco,</hi> where art thou now?

Wherefore I would haue you ſhew me where he is, otherwiſe, I will doe worſe then I haue hetherto done. I know not (ſaid ſhe) who thou art, nor by what meanes thou haſt ſo great power, but I am well aſſured and I would neuer haue thought that twenty ſuch knights (as once this day I did eſtéeme thée) could euer haue attained to the achieuing of ſo great an enterprice and much leſſe to haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my art as thou haſt done, ſo that conſidering thereof, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this thy power procéedeth from him in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my yong yeares I did once beléeue, and ſince that haue forſaken him, to follow the workes of the common enemie of all mankinde, who according to his naturall inſtinction, hath iuſtly rewarded me to my deſert: therefore it were but folly to denie thée any thing, that art ſo ſurely defended by him to whome all thinges are obedient. Follow me then (ſaid ſhe) and I will ſhew thée the king, but as I thinke, it is not he thou ſéekeſt. And with that ſhee roſe vp &amp; went into a darke chamber, the knight following her: then ſhe opened an yron gate and ſaid vnto him goe in, and there ſhalt thou finde the priſoner. Ladie (ſaied the knight) if it were to fight I would not faile to doe your commandement, but if by ſubtiltie I ſhould be ſhut in priſon, you would laugh at me that I had no more wit but to put my truſt in you, wherefore goe you in firſt, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer happeneth, you may haue your part, I ſée well (ſaied the lady) that my labour is in vaine, and all my art is nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thée, therefore I am content to doe thy will, but we haue no light to ſée. Care you not for that (ſaied he) for I will prouide you light, and with that hee pulled of the taffata that couered the ſcabberd of his ſword, whereby there was ſo great a brightneſſe in the place, as if the ſunne had ſhone therein. Then they deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                  <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Ing <hi>Luiſart,</hi> the black knight, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being entred into the hall, as they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out at the windowes into the ſea, there entered a Gentlewoman, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reuerence vnto the lady, ſhee ſaied, Madame, your ſonne <hi>Matroco</hi> with his ſhips is euen now arriued at the foote of the rock, &amp; with him great numbers of other veſſels, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath taken vpon the ſeas, What is your pleaſure to ſay vnto him? When the ladie heard her ſhee waxed pale, and with teares in her eies, anſwered her and ſaid, I would to God he were as farre from hence as hee is néere: for my heart giueth mee he will ſpéed in the like maner that others haue done before him, And as ſhee ſpake, king <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the knight looked into the ſea, and perceiuing the Giants fléet ſurging on the ſhoare out of wind and weather, among the which they knew <hi>Elizabeth Libee</hi> his nephue, and diuers others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were bound in chaines, making great ſorrow, but none of <hi>Matrocos</hi> men durſt ſet foot on land, hauing already ben aduertiſed by ſome of the caſtle, of the great miſfortune happened therein, and for the ſame cauſe ſtaied ſo long without, till the Giant eſpied at the windowes the knight and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king looking vpon them, wherewith in a great rage hée cried vnto the blacke knight whom he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all armed, and ſaied vnto him: Thou accurſed ſlaue is it thou that ſo cowardly hath ſlaine my vncle, my brother, and the porter
<pb facs="tcp:191458:15"/> of my caſtle? When the knight heard him, he anſwerd him and ſaid, I haue done my endeuour to make thée know, that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not to ſuch as thou art either to impriſon kings, or to moleſt and gréeue ſo many men as continually thou doeſt. By all my gods (ſaid <hi>Matroco</hi>) fortune fauoureth thée too much, when at my arriuall I finde thée armed with the wals of this my caſtle, for if I had thée here vpon the ſhore, I would ſoone ſend thée fiſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea as I haue done many other raſh and bold fooles like thy ſelfe, that haſt enterpriſed without cauſe to inforce my caſtle, but if I continue here tenne yeares together, I will neuer depart hence till I haue thée in my hands, then ſhalt thou know how I vſe to handle ſuch as thou art. Stay a while (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> black knight) there is much more difference betwéene ſaying and doing, then there is diſtance of place betwéene thée and me. Thy threatnings make me more aſſured, wherefore now I feare thée leſſer then I did before, and that thou maieſt well know it to bee ſo, take thy choice whether I ſhall come downe to fight with thée, or thou come vp to me. Then ſhalt thou plainely ſée to whome God will giue the victory, either to thée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truſteſt in thine owne ſtrength, or to mee, that truſt onely in him. The greateſt oxen and fatteſt buls are oftentimes brought vnto the ſlaughter as well as leſſer beaſts. So thou great beaſt, I aduiſe thée to remember thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life before worſe happen vnto thée, forſaking thy accurſed faith which thou now holdeſt, &amp; with might maintaineſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bee thou aſſured the wrath of God will fall vpon thée, as it hath already done vpon thy friends. That ſhall bee ſéene (ſaied <hi>Matroco</hi>) and if thou haſt the courage to ſtay for mee, I aſſure thée, thou wilt bee glad to denie the villainous wordes thou now haſt vttered. Therefore cauſe the gate to bee opened, for ſéeing thou putteſt mée to my choice, I will come vp to thée, were it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dungeon, from whence thou haſt deliuered that villaine ſtanding by thée, and therwith leauing his company behind him, being all armed, he began to mount vp the rocke, and went vnto the caſtle, but when he came to the yron gate, (which he found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, becauſe the watch had left it and were gone) and ſaw <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes</hi> lying dead, hee was in a manner out of his wits, not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:191458:16"/> much for the proweſſe he knew to be in him, as that he had from his youth beene nouriſhed and bred vp in the caſtle by the Giant his father. Neuertheleſſe hée diſſembled his griefe, hoping to bee reuenged at his pleaſure, and going further, in another place hee found the Giant armed all in gréene, dead and freſhly bléeding, wherewith he was ſo moued, that he ſtaied and ſtood ſtill, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth a great ſigh, began to crie out and ſaied, alas <hi>Arcalaus</hi> my good vncle, how néere doth the loſſe of thee goe to my heart, whereſoeuer it had happened, but eſpecially being done within mine own caſtle, wherein I thought long time to liue and make merry with thée: Alas is fortune ſo cruell vnto thée, that after ſo many trauailes and dangerous aduentures, with infinite perils, that in the flower of thy youth thou haſt ſuſtained, thou muſt in thine old yeares come and receiue ſo cruell a death within my houſe, which I eſtéemed as an aſſured hold and defence, not only for me, but for thée and the reſt of our kindred and friends? O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall gods, what vengeance can I take vpon the Traitor that hath ſo much offended me, ſéeing that to cauſe him to die each day a hundred times were nothing in reſpect of the miſchiefe he hath done vnto mée? At the leaſt if it were <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> ſo much eſtéemed of all men or any of his two brethren, or all they thrée together, my griefe would bee ſomewhat eaſed by reaſon of the ſorrowes I would cauſe them to indure. But what? Now I am conſtrained to fight againſt one alone, who by reaſon conſidring the trauell hee hath taken all this day, ought already to eſtéeme himſelfe ouercome and vanquiſhed: What glory then can I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by winning victory againſt him? Trewly as much as if I fought againſt a ſimple woman, being (as by nature ſhee is) both weake and féeble, ſo hee vnworthy of my preſence will bee much prowder if I doe but make a countenance to fight with him: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe what blot ſoeuer may happen vnto mine honour, of force hee muſt die. In this manner did the Giant lament ouer the body of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> his dead vncle, not mouing from thence, till at laſt hee perceiued the blacke knight that ſtoode to heare him, wherewith being ſomewhat aſhamed he marched towards him, thinking without hinderance to enter into the dungeon, but hee
<pb facs="tcp:191458:16"/> found the blacke knight at the gate that boldly thruſt him backe, and ſaied vnto him, Thou brutiſh and vnreaſonable beaſt, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou to enter in by force? Whereat the Giant all abaſhed, ſtaied without and ſaid, Thou biddeſt me to come vp, haue I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> done thée wrong to come at thy commandement? No (ſaied the knight) but beholding thy countenance, it ſéemeth thou wouldeſt enter by authority, and therewith ſtepping aſide, he ſaied: Now come in and doe what thou canſt. When the old woman (with whom king <hi>Luiſart</hi> talked) perceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ready to fight, in great feare ſhe ran out of the hall, and fel downe at her ſonnes féet, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and ſaid, alas <hi>Matroco,</hi> I pray thée, and by the duty a child oweth vnto the mother I commaund thée not to enter into this combate, for thou knoweſt well that of all thy brethren, thou art onely left aliue, wherewith my heart is ſo gréeued, that had it not been for the loue I beare thée, thou haddeſt found mee now at thy returne in as pittiful eſtate as thou ſéeſt thy brother <hi>Frerion:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any woman at this preſent liuing in the world, that ought (with better reaſon) to wiſh for death then I. Alas what fortune is this, that now again I muſt renue the ſorrows, which both time and long patience (as I thought) had buried in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion? Alas miſerable woman that I am, I only haue forged the weapon that hath giuen the wound, whereby at this preſent I receiue this dommage, for vpon the day of my huſbands deceaſe, thinking to reuenge the griefe that my ſoule ſuſtained, I haue to the contrary aduanced mine owne ſhame and vtter ruine, iuſtly receiuing the reward that belongeth vnto ſuch, as refuſing the better part thinke to remedy one miſchiefe by procuring a worſe vpon themſelues. Madame (ſaid the Giant) if at this preſent you haue receiued great loſſe by the death of ſome of your friends, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe you ought not to take it ſo offenſiuely, ſéeing they haue ended their daies in honourable combate, as behooueth all worthy knights ſuch as they were. And as for me, think you that for feare of death I will refuſe to doe that whereunto by knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood I am bound? No, no: likewiſe what reaſon or what excuſe ſhould moue me, being as I am both freſh and wel diſpoſed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the combat alone againſt one ſimple knight? I deny not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:17"/> but confeſſe that affection cauſeth you to vſe theſe words, and ſhew the nature of a woman: but you muſt conceiue &amp; think with your ſelfe that I anſwere you as it becommeth me, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mine honour before your teares, wherefore I beſéech you ſuffer mee to take the ſmall vengeance I can vpon the villaine that hath ſo much offended mee. <hi>Matroco</hi> (ſaied the knight) thou reckoneſt before thine hoſt, I would not for all the gold in the world loſe ſuch an occaſion offered as I now haue, both for mine honour and aduantage. Beléeue mee, that neither thy mothers teares, nor the duty thou oweſt vnto her (as being her child) can by any meanes prolong the end of thée or me, if without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thou doeſt not by oath promiſe and aſſure mée to liue in as good ſort from this time f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore it were better for thée to make mee know by effect the Proweſſe thou vaunteſt thy ſelfe to haue, and for me to let thée ſée the curteſie, which it may bee thou ſhalt find at my hands if I ouercome thée. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lady perceiued that her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could take no place ſhe left them, and the two knights began to runne one vpon the other ſo brauely and with ſuch fury, that king <hi>Luiſart</hi> beholding them thought he neuer ſaw ſo cruel a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which abaſhed him more was, that hee could not preſume how or in what manner the blacke Knight had found him in ſo ſtrange a place, and yet he knew him not: ſometime hee thought him to be <hi>Amadis,</hi> but when he remembred the loue he bare vnto the lady <hi>Oriana</hi> that hee had newly married, hee was otherwiſe perſuaded, and likewiſe hee remembred very well the combates hee had ſéene <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> make at Windſore againſt <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan le Superbe,</hi> and after that with <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> wherein hee vſed all his forces, yet were they not comparable to thoſe of the blacke knights: who as then found himſelfe as freſh and wel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fight as if hee had not fought all the day before. Againe when he thought it to be his nephew <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for that <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> had foreſhewed many wonderfull things of him, he was ſoone diſſuaded from that opinion by reaſon hée left him with the quéen his mother, not once ſéeking to receiue the order of knighthood, and although that ſince his departure out of Brittaine he might
<pb facs="tcp:191458:17"/> haue obtained that honour, yet did hee eſtéeme it impoſſible for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to doe ſo valiantly at the firſt. Further <hi>Vrganda</hi> had alwaies propheſied of him that the firſt valiant acts he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue ſhould be renowned and ſpoken of by his ſtrange &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nauigation in the great ſerpent, wherein he ſhould be imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and for the blacke knight he knew he arriued there in a little barke vnfurniſhed, whereby he eſtéemed it vnlikely to be his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> But hée thought hee neuer had ſéene ſo valiant and hardy a knight, for the longer he fought, the more he weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laboured <hi>Matroco.</hi> Neuertheleſſe hee continued fighting for the ſpace of two hours together before it could be iudged who ſhould haue the victory, but in the end the Giant féeling himſelfe wounded in ſo many places (his armour altogether broken, and his ſhield halfe clouen in two) began to miſtruſt his owne force. Wherefore ſtepping backe he ſtaied his hand, and ſaied: Knight I pray thée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs breath our ſelues a while, and hear what I wil offer thée, which cannot bee other then to thy honour and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. With that the knight ſtood ſtill, and <hi>Matroco</hi> began to ſpeake, ſaying: I wonder (ſir knight) what mooued thée to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this manner vpon this rocke, wherein neuer any but thy ſelfe durſt enterpriſe to come during my fathers life, neither yet ſithence that by his death I haue ben lord therof, and beſides this thy enterpriſe, wherein thou haſt done the thing that all others feared to doe before thée, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This anſwere of the blacke knight moued the Giant in ſuch manner, that like a wilde Beare hee began to fome at the mouth, and ſaied vnto the knight.

Which the blacke knight beholding, for ioy thanked God with all his heart, and taking his ſword by the point preſented the handle to <hi>Matroco,</hi> ſaying vnto him: Truly valiant knight, among ſo many triumphant victories y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in times paſt you haue obtained, there neuer happened any one ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as this, for that herein you haue not onely vanquiſhed mée, but your ſelf alſo, that for ſtrength of body are inuincible: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a victorious knight, I preſent my ſword vnto you.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:21"/> in this bed, and laſtly of the third called <hi>Frerion,</hi> whome thou haſt ſlaine, and my brother alſo, that went to helpe <hi>Argantes</hi> the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this caſtle. And being thus married vnto ſuch a huſband as <hi>Cartadaque,</hi> was ſo much feared and redoubted in all places, and hauing thrée of the moſt valiant and worthy knights to my ſons, that euer liued, I was ſo eleuated in pride, and ſo little eſtéemed of cruell fortune, that I thought it vnpoſſible for her to work me any woe. But by tract of time I found it otherwiſe, for by little and little ſhee hath wholly chaunged my ioy into moſt gréeuous ſorrow, and wilt thou know how? Then I thinke thou doeſt yet remember the diſcord that long ſithence happened betwéene thée and <hi>Childadan</hi> king of Ireland, and of the battaile wherein thou ouercammeſt him, where my deceaſed huſband minding to bee preſent, expreſſely departed from hence thether, and as accurſed fortune would, tooke my ſonne <hi>Lindoraque</hi> with him, and hauing trauailed many countries, at the laſt arriued at the place where my brother ſtaied for them, trauailing all three together with full purpoſe and intent to doe thée all the iniury they could, and they had ſcarce entered into a forreſt not farre from London, but they met a knight as then ſurnamed <hi>Le Beautenebreux,</hi> riding in company of a Gentlewoman, that ware on her head a Cal all ſet with ſtrange flowers, whome my ſonne (as accurſed fortune would) liked ſo wel, that with a great deſire to haue hir to preſent vnto the Lady <hi>Madaſine</hi> his loue, commanded one of his ſquires to go fetch her to him, which the knight called <hi>Le beau tenebreux,</hi> whereof I ſpeak, would not permit, but ſent the meſſenger back againe well beaten, wherewith my ſonne being moued, thought to haue her by force, but it fell out otherwiſe for him, for at the firſt encounter the knight with one blow with his ſword, thruſt him into the body, whereof hee died, and as much had chanced to his vncle <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> if his horſe had not ſaued him by running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, hauing firſt loſt foure of his fingers on the right hand. Yet fortune not contenting her ſelfe with this miſchiefe, prepared me a worſe, for my huſband (who for his valour and prowes was feared and redoubted throughout all Aſia and Europe) was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly ſlaine by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame murtherer of <hi>Lindoraque,</hi> vpon the ſame day
<pb facs="tcp:191458:21"/> the battell was fought, if thou canſt remember it, whereby euer ſithence I remained a widdow with my other ſonnes as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yong and tender of age, with whom I haue paſſed the greateſt part of my daies moſt extreamely, wéeping and lamenting with continuall ſadneſſe, which had ben more gréeuous vnto mee, had it not ben for the hope I conceiued of their valour and proweſſe. But to come to the point of my diſcourſe, time &amp; reaſon hauing in a maner ſuppreſſed my forepaſſed ſorrows, news was brought me of the laſt victory thou diddeſt obtaine by the Proweſſe of the knight named <hi>Le beautenebreux</hi> (now as it is ſaid, called <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi>) and likewiſe of my brothers impriſonment, wherwith I was ſo gréeued, that reſpecting not my old yeares, I tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to trauaile into Brittaine, hoping by ſome meanes to get him out of thy hands. But before I arriued there, I had certain newes of his deliuery, neuertheleſſe conſidering with my ſelfe the forepaſſed iniuries I haue receiued by thy kinſmen, namely by that wicked wretch <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> I determined before my returne hether to finde the meanes to make him knowe that ſmall good will I beare him. But hauing imploied all my art, and finding it in vaine to worke any further therein againſt him, by reaſon of a ring he beareth daily on his finger, giuen him by that wicked enchauntreſſe <hi>Vrganda:</hi> I determined to proue my ſkill (which could not take effect in him) againſt thée, being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of thy often riding to hunt, with very fewe in thy company, where I made thée ſée one of my Gentlewomen and a villaine that would defloure her, whom thou thoughteſt to ſuccour, and if thou now remembreſt mee, I am the very ſame thou foundeſt in the pauillion, following after him that fled before thée, and there thou remainedſt inchaunted, from whence wee carried thée into our barke, and without knowledge vnto any but mine owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, thou waſt brought hether by ſea, with full deliberation to cauſe thée languiſh in priſon: in the meane time with the helpe of my allies and friends, thy countrey ſhould bée inuaded, but I find my ſelfe deceiued.

While <hi>Arcabonne</hi> made this long diſcourſe, the king that ſtill beheld her in the face, remembred well it was ſhe to whom hée ſpake in the pauillion, wherefore hee ſaid vnto her, In good faith madame I now beléeue you better then at the firſt, yet mee thinketh you doe mee wrong to make mee beare the burthen of another mans offence. Thinkeſt thou ſo (ſaid ſhee?) No truly, for thy impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only had wrought great domage vnto diuers men, but to me and mine great profit and aduantage.

My lord, if it pleaſeth your grace to ſhew mee ſo much fauour, as to aſſiſt mee in a thing, that importeth as much as my life, in behalfe of the knight, that you ſo much deſire to ſée, before to morrow at night I will ſhew him vnto you, if you think good, in ſuch a place, where you may eaſily ſpeake with him: and to the end you ſhall not ſuſpect me of vntruth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wil ſhew you a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine token, that when you ſée it, I am aſſured you will eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue me.

I beſéech your grace (ſaied ſhe) when you are both togither, it would pleaſe you to be a mean vnto him in my behalfe to graunt me a gift that I ſhall aſk him. By the faith of a Prince (ſaied hée) I will not faile to doe it, nor a greater matter then that, if it lieth in my power. Then follow me (ſaied the Gentlewoman) bringing him where ſhee had laied the ſword, and ſhewing it vnto him, aſked if he had neuer ſéene it. That I haue (ſaid the king) and I would to God the knight that

Content (ſaid the king) wherewith hee went out of the chamber, and paſſing through the court, he met <hi>Libee</hi> and others, to whome hee ſaied, that in the morning he meant to walke along the rocke (becauſe maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had certefied him, it was ſo goodly a countrey) and that none but <hi>Carmelle</hi> ſhould beare him company, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into other ſpéeches, they paſſed the time till they went to reſt, but the king could not ſléepe for the great deſire he had to ſée the knight, whereby he was hardly fallen aſléep, when <hi>Carmelle</hi> came to awake him, ſaying: My lord, may it pleaſe your grace to remember your promiſe? Let vs goe (ſaied hée) and there with making himſelfe ready, commanded two horſes to bée ſadled, one for himſelfe, the other for <hi>Carmelle,</hi> and iſſuing out of the caſtle, rode towards the Hermitage. And they had not trauelled farre, but they perceiued a man comming towards them in great haſt, and as hee came néere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I ride to the caſtle (ſaid hee) to fetch <hi>Matroco</hi> and his brother <hi>Frerian,</hi> with all ſpéed to helpe their vncle <hi>Lindoraque,</hi> who comming to ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath met with two knights armed all in white, that haue ſlaine his men, and (as I thinke) I left him in as great danger as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may bee. When the king heard him, hee thought them to bee of the blacke knights company, and ſaid vnto the Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray you ſtay here with this man, and I will ride to ſée them, and with that hee ſet ſpurres to his horſe, and taking the ſame way the other came, he perceiued a far off the two knights figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Giant, that defended himſelfe moſt valiantly with his mare, forcing them oftentimes to recule, but the two knights as bold and nimble, handled him in ſuch ſort, that hee knew not how to defend himſelfe, and if hee had not ſlaine one of their horſes, it had gone worſe with him. Neuertheleſſe the knight on horſebacke ſeeking to reuenge his companion, was nothing aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,

Mean time the knight on foot, went vnto the Giant, and taking him by the left leg, pulled him by ſuch force, that both hee and the other knight fell off their horſes, and holding each other faſt, the Giant fell vnder with his face vpwards, wherewith the knight that threw him downe, thruſt him into the face, that hee was conſtrained to let goe his hold, neuertheleſſe riſing vp againe with great force, and laying hold vpon the knight that had ſo wounded him, hee threw him on the ground, meane time the other gaue the Giant ſuch a blow vpon the head, that hée began to réele, and therewith ſtretching out his legs, yéelded vp the ghoſt. With that the king rode ſomewhat néerer, and perceiued the two knights to beare black croſſes, that ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Chriſtians, wherefore riding boldly vnto them, hee went ſo néere that they knew him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they went to doe him honour, much abaſhed to ſée him.

And it pleaſeth your grace (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) we ſéeke after a knight armed all in blacke, of whome as yet wee can heare no newes. Doe you know his name (ſaid the king?)

My lord, where hath your grace got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten company ſo ſoone? Gentlewoman (ſaid he) you ſhall know it all in good time, but what haue you done (ſaied hee) with the man that I left with you? Let vs know what newes he hath told you.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they roſe from dinner, the king deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to tell him how he was made knight, as alſo what happened vnto him ſince that time, to the end (ſaied hée) that <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Ambor</hi> may doe the like. Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> tolde how <hi>Vrganda</hi> came vnto the Ferme iſland in the great ſerpent, what ſpéech ſhee had with <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and others that were with him, the order ſhee vſed to dub him knight, together with <hi>Talanque, Ambor, Manely,</hi> &amp; the king
<pb facs="tcp:191458:31"/> of Denmarke: The ſléepe wherein they fell, and that when hee awaked, he found himſelfe at the foot of the rocke of the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, in company of <hi>Sergil</hi> his Squire and two dumb men, alſo how he conquered the ſword, with his arriuall at the mountain, where he found the Hermite, that diſſuaded him from fighting with the giants. By my head (ſaid the king) I neuer heard ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger things, And now <hi>Ambor</hi> (ſaied hee) what became of you? My lord (ſaied <hi>Ambor</hi>) my companion and I were likewiſe aſléepe, and when we awaked we found our ſelues in a little barke with our two horſes, in a Hauen of the ſea called <hi>Armata</hi> in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Norway (as then vnknowne to vs) where wee landed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a towne, not only to know in what countrey wee were, but alſo to ſéeke for victuals. And as wee went towards it, the watch of the towne (by reaſon of certain diſſenſion not long before mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued betwéene them and their neighbours) ſent to knowe what we would haue. Wherewith we made them anſwere, wée were knights aduenturous that came from the Ferme Iſle, caſt vpon that ſhore by tempeſt of weather. In good truth ſaid he that ſpake vnto vs, our king hath ſo great cauſe to vſe your helpes, that if you goe vnto him, I am well aſſured hee will bid you welcome. We aſked him the kings name, and what country wee were in. My lords (ſaid he) the country is called Norway, wherof <hi>Adroni</hi> father in lawe to <hi>Agraies,</hi> ſonne to the king of Scots, and one of the beſt knights in the world, is our king, I know not whether you know him. And what cauſe ſaied wee, hath your king to vſe our helpe? I will tell you (ſaid he) he is ſo old, that one of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, his ſiſters ſonne, (procured therevnto by euil counſel) is riſen in armes againſt him, ſéeking to haue the gouernement of the countrey, in reſpect (as hee ſaith) his vncle is no more able to rule the ſame. And vnder that pretence hath already vſurped a great part thereof, and now lieth in campe before one of the beſt citties in this land, which the king by no meanes can reléeue, by reaſon that moſt of his truſtieſt friends haue forſaken him, and hold with the yoong preſumptuous foole, that winneth them by faire promiſes, a thing that oftentimes happeneth vnto ſuch as fortune fauoureth not, and when men are fallen, they are not
<pb facs="tcp:191458:31"/> only abandoned of ſtraungers, but by their owne kindred and friends, that properly may be tearmed friends for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent time. In good faith ſaid we, if the towne will giue vs victuals, and one to guide vs, we will gladly goe and preſent our ſeruice vnto him, not onely for the loue of <hi>Agraies,</hi> to whom wee are companions, but for the right he hath, as you haue told vs. That ſhall be done (ſaid he) and therewith deſired vs to ſtay till he came again from the cittie, where he ſtaied not long, but hee brought what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and a guide that conducted vs ſo wel, that the next day about dinner time we arriued where the king lay. Who being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of our comming, and that wée were of <hi>Agraies</hi> companions, entertained vs moſt courteouſly, commaunding one of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to vnarme vs in one of his beſt chambers, whether hee came, and after hee had bidden vs welcome, beganne in the ſame manner to ſhew vs all what the watch had before declared vnto vs, and what an vnnaturall part his nephew ſhewed vnto him, procured therevnto by two knights, in whome onely hée putteth his whole truſt, becauſe (ſaied hee) they are well aſſured, that not any of my knights dareth enter into combat with them, they are eſtéemed ſo valiant and hardy. But who hath mooued them and your coſin (ſaid we) to vndertake ſo foule an action? Becauſe (ſaid the king) I haue no iſſue male, and my couſin alledgeth I am ouer old to gouerne the countrey, ſaying, it is fitter for him then for me to do it: but if I can I will hold him from it, and kéep it for my doughter <hi>Olinde</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> her huſband: By my ſoule (ſaid I) I am of this opinion, that ſéeing this warre is begun on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to trie the title, you both pretend in one thing, It were good your quarrell ſhoule bee ended by the combate of two knights of both parts, without the death and deſtruction of ſo many poore innocent people as daily periſh by the ſame means, remitting the iſſue thereof to thoſe whome it ſhall pleaſe God to make victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and if it pleaſeth you, I and my companion will bee the two knights that ſhall fight for you. But when hée heard mee ſpeake in that manner, hee pauſed a while, ſéeming very penſiue, till in the end he anſwered me and ſaied, Sir knights, I am not yet ſo well acquainted with you, that I ſhould venture to hazard ſo
<pb facs="tcp:191458:32"/> great a kingdome as this is vpon your valour, Neuertheleſſe, if you will aſſure me for a truth that you are knights of the Ferme Iſland, I am content to ſtand to it whatſoeuer may chance. For there can none but valiant knights come from thence, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured (as I ſuppoſe) that otherwiſe the lord of the place would not giue them intertainement. Then wee ſwore vnto him, that what wee had ſaied was true. Wherevpon hee preſently diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a trumpet with meſſage to his enemy, to offer him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who hearing the newes ſéemed very glad, making account that his two knights (ſo much eſtéemed) would eaſily ouercome any two of the beſt knights the king had. So that returning the meſſenger againe, hee ſent one of his trumpets with him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the combate, with the day, time and place where it ſhould be done, as alſo what pledges ſhould on both ſides bee giuen for performance thereof, ſo that on the day appointed, after ech par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſolemnly taken their othes, wée entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liſts, where wee had a cruell and dangerous combate one againſt the other, but in the end right lying on our ſides, wee wan the victory. And as we would haue ſtriken off their heads, the kings nephew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired vs moſt earneſtly to graunt him their liues, which wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vnto, vpon condition, that from that time forwards hee ſhould ſuffer his vncle to raigne in peace, not moleſting him any more, which he promiſed to performe. In this combate we were ſo wounded, that of force we continued in Norway longer then wee meant to do, where during our abode, certaine marchants arriued in the cittie, that had ſéene (as they told vs) vpon the ſea, néere vnto the rocke of the Enchauntreſſe, a Serpent greater then any veſſell, which ſo much aſtoniſhed them, that they knew not what to doe, whereby we heard newes of <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> With that (although we were not altogether healed of our wounds) yet we beſought the king to cauſe vs to bee conducted thether, which hee willingly graunted, and wee tooke ſea, with ſo good a wind, that within ſixe daies after wee approched the rocke where the ſerpent ſtaied, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the firſt made vs ſomewhat abaſhed, although we had ſéene it oftentimes before. Neuertheleſſe, we found it fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuch flames of fire out of the mouth and noſthrils thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:32"/> that wee feared the fire would fall into our ſhippe, whereby not without much paine and trouble, wee procured our maiſter and marriners to approch it, and perceiuing no creature aboord to ſpeake vnto, we began to hallow vnto them with ſo loud a voice, that at the laſt <hi>Sergil</hi> appeared vpon the hatches, and wéeping, told vs what had happened vnto his maiſter on the rocke of the Enchauntreſſe, and how after that one of the dumbe men had cauſed him to enter into a little barke, and there with put to ſea, ſo that hée knew not if hee were dead or liuing, for hee had heard no newes of him, and there hee ſtaied with another dumbe man in the greateſt care that might bée. With that wee willed him to call the dumbe man vnto vs, and when hee came, by ſignes wée made vnto him, we ſhewed him what pleaſure he might doe vs if he would bring vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where his fellow had carried <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> which as it ſéemed he was content to doe, for preſently ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he entered into our veſſels and ſailed ſo well, that the tenth day after he ſet vs on land, hard by the place where wee ſlew the Giant and the two knights, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But as then it was very darke, and the wind blew ſo hard, that the ſea riſing therewith, beat againſt the hollowneſſe of the rocke, in ſuch ſort that the noiſe thereof, and the ſound of the muſicke, made a new kind of harmony: wherewith hee was ſo much delighted, that hee awaked <hi>Eſplandian, Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque,</hi> that ſlept ſoundly, as yoong men without malancholy humours, are accuſtomed to doe. But when they heard the muſicke, they ſtaied not long in their beds, but went to the window to ſée who it might bee, but they could ſée nothing till day began to appeare. When they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the great Serpent ſurging on the ſhoare, wherwith they were excéeding glad, making full account that the arriuall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of brought them ſome good newes: Wherewith they made them ready, and without longer ſtaying, iſſued out of the caſtle, to ſée who was in the ſame, and as they ſtood on the ſhore, they percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a ſmal boat, and a Gentlewoman comming out of it, bearing in her arms a packet couered with Taffata, who comming vnto the king, with moſt humble reuerence ſaied vnto him. My lord, and it pleaſeth your grace, <hi>Vrganda</hi> recommendeth her vnto your maieſty, and hath commanded me to giue you intelligence, that being buſied to aide the Emperour and the Empreſſe your doughter, in a certaine thing of great importance, ſhee hath not had the means to come and viſite you. Then preſenting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> packet to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſaid vnto him, Gentle knight, My miſtreſſe that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and fauoureth you, as it is well knowne, giueth you theſe armes, and ſendeth you word by mee, that as ſhee gaue you the blacke armes, that hetherto you haue borne (to teſtifie thereby the ſorrow for the loſſe of the king, that as then was common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all his true ſubiects and friends) So in theſe you ſhal finde the deuiſe of the lady, that in beautie and comelineſſe of perſon ſurpaſſeth all the ladies in the world, as <hi>Amadis</hi> your father in time paſt well proued, when ſhee ſet the crowne vpon her head, in remembraunce whereof ſhee hath euer ſithence borne the like

Which ſhe ſaid in reſpect of the princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> doughter to the Emperour of Conſtantinople, that by deſtinie was appointed only vnto him. And opening the pack ſhee pulled out a helmet, ſhield, Haubert, and a Capariſſon for a horſe all of white, imbrodered with crowns of gold, and ſet with Diamonds and Pearles, which hée moſt willingly receiued, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gentlewoman: I pray you in my behalfe giue <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> hearty thankes for the great honour and much good ſhee hath continually done vnto me, aſſuring her, that whereſoeuer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſhe hath a knight of mee ready to obay her, and that for the loue of her will beare theſe armes as long as it pleaſeth her. Bée it ſo in the name of God (ſaied ſhe) but before long time bee paſt, you ſhall haue another miſtreſſe, that will conſtraine you to doe greater matters, for ſhée ſhall rauiſh both your heart and libertie in ſuch manner, that you ſhould looſe ouermuch, if at ſometimes you looſe not your ſelfe for her.

Wherfore I pray you tell her, that whatſoeuer I haue, is at her commandement, and as touching my determination, which (as ſoone as I conceiued in my mind, I perceiued it was knowne to her) being at home, if God giueth me life, I meane to put in execution.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gentlewoman that brought the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with the two dumbe men, imbarked and put to ſea, farre from the rocke: king <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the reſt went vnto the caſtle, where he ſtaied not long, for according to the aduiſe <hi>Vrganda</hi> had giuen him, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Ambor</hi> &amp; <hi>Talanque</hi> with <hi>Libee</hi> and the reſt of the company to kéep the caſtle, promiſing with all ſpéed to ſend them prouiſion of all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, whereof they wanted. But when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaw there was no remedy, but of force he muſt obey the king (much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to depart ſo farre from the borders of Conſtantinople, where he hoped to find her whereof maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had brought him the firſt newes) hée tooke his faithfull ſeruant <hi>Carmelle</hi> aſide, and ſaid vnto her: My good friend, I was in mind neuer to falſifie the promiſe I haue made you, nor the gift you required at my hands, neuertheleſſe, truſting more in you then any other, I pray you take it not in euill part, if (to ſaue my life) I ſend you to a place, whether I thought to haue gone my ſelf in perſon, but it pleaſeth the king (as you wel know) that I ſhal beare him company.

My good friend (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) imbracing her, I wil one day recompence your good will, &amp; ſéeing you are minded to do me ſo much fauour, you muſt then take your iourney to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, on meſſage to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> the Emperours

Notwithſtanding, it hath pleaſed her (by maiſtee <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>) to put mee in mind thereof, although while breath is in my body I will neuer faile to be her knight. And to the end ſhee may giue credite to your meſſage, you ſhal preſent this ring vnto her, which ſhe knoweth well, as being the ſame ſhe gaue vnto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to put him in remembrance of his promiſe.

Then calling <hi>Libee,</hi> hee commanded him, that preſently after hee had ſet ſaile, hee ſhould cauſe a ſhip to be prepared for <hi>Carmelle,</hi> to goe on meſſage where he would ſend her, that done, hee went to finde the king and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſtaied for him in the Serpent, the which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon his entring therein, of her ſelf began to ſet forwards with ſuch ſpéede, that in ſhort ſpace they left the coaſt of Turkie, and the twentith day after, they diſcouered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ferme Iſle, where ſhe ſtaied, which thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country perceiuing, aduertiſed <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and the reſt of the company, who in great haſt ran vnto the Hauen, but they were no ſooner come thether, when they eſpied the king, <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> maiſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Sergil,</hi> landing out of a little boat.

And as they entred into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where they vſed commonly to chaſe the Hart, they ſaw in the high way foure knights, well mounted &amp; armed at all points, each his Eſquire by his ſide, bearing their ſhield and launces, for they had their helmets on their heads. And with that they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Gentlewoman comming towards them, riding on a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, and being néere them, ſpeaking to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſhe ſaied, Sir knight with the white armes, thoſe foure knights you ſée in the high way before you, ſend you word by me, that they would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the cauſe why you beare the deuiſe of crownes, wherin
<pb facs="tcp:191458:36"/> if you ſatiſfie their deſire, in ſuch ſort that their honours bee not ſtained, they will from henceforth refraine to inquire the ſame any more: otherwiſe, they giue you by me to vnderſtand, it were beſt for you to leaue them, or elſe that you defend them well, as being the moſt honourable deuiſe that is in all the world. When <hi>Eſplandian</hi> heard her ſpeake in that manner, in courteous ſort he anſwered her and ſaid. Gentlewoman, to ſatiſfie their requeſt I pray you tell them, that the deuiſe and the armes I beare was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me by <hi>Vrganda,</hi> but for what cauſe I know not, neuertheles I bear them for the loue of her, as alſo that they like me wel: and if this content them not, tel them, mee thinketh the occaſion of combate betwéene mee and them is ſo ſmall, that for this time I would deſire them to forbeare the ſame. In good faith (ſaied ſhee) ſmiling, you ſpeak with reaſon, for they are knights that ſéeme to haue much néed of your counſell, but notwithſtanding good ſir, I pray you bee not vnprouided, for your excuſes will not bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Neuertheleſſe, either you muſt forſake the way to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and this good company, or defend the braue deuiſe you bear, as they haue ſent you word. The way (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, and out of it (for them) I will not goe, wherefore if they aſſaile me, I muſt of force defend my ſelf. And becauſe the Gentlewoman was not knowne among them, they all muſed who ſhe might me, as alſo who the foure knights were that ſent her, to whom ſhée returned againe. Meane time <hi>Eſplandian</hi> laced on his helmet, taking his launce in his hand, ready to fight if occaſion ſerued. Wherewith <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were excéeding glad, doubting leaſt the king had ſpoken in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of him, when he ſhewed what he had done, but they had not ridden long, but one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> four knights came riding ſoftly towards them, and about a carriers length from them, called to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid, You ſir knight that would not ſatiſfie our deſires, defend
<pb facs="tcp:191458:36"/> your ſelfe from mee. Wherewith hee ſet ſpurres to his horſe and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> likewiſe, who at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt encounter caſt him ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his ſaddle, that in long time after hee could not riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and therewith his launce brake: with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſecond knight came forwards, willing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to take another launce, for he meant to reuenge his companion. Which <hi>Amadis</hi> hearing, ſent him his launce, that he willingly receiued, and being in a rage to ſée himſelfe aſſailed without cauſe, hée ranne againſt the knight, and ſtrake him ſo ſurely on the breſt, that he ouerthrew him both horſe and man. Well (ſaid the king) to the ſtanders by, iudge you if it be poſſible to doe better? My lord (ſaid <hi>Agraies</hi>) I neuer ſaw two fairer ſtrokes giuen with a launce, the reſt I will leaue to conſider of till I know thoſe that ranne againſt him. Let vs ſée the end (ſaied the king) and calling a Squire, hee ſent his launce vnto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> for as then the third knight prepared himſelfe to runne, and ſpurring their horſes, ſet forwards ſo fiercely, that breaking their launces, they met ſo ſtrongly, body and ſhields, and heads together, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had much adoe to ſit vpon his horſe, and the other had ſuch a fall, that he lay ſtil vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.

And with that he called <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaid, Knight, Although I well know the ſmall courteſie, that I and my companions haue ſhewed vnto you, yet I muſt not refuſe to doe the ſame that they haue done before me, wherefore I pray you ſend to ſome of your company for another launce, that we may ſée who ſhall beare the honour of this enterpriſe. I will doe it (ſaied hee) ſéeing you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me therevnto, vpon condition that if I can, I will ſerue you in the like ſort I haue done your companions. With that <hi>Granſador</hi> that heard them ſpeake, gaue him his launce, which he preſently charging, they met together with ſuch force, that their launces brake cloſe vnto their hands, neither of them remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out his ſaddle, wherefore the knight of the forreſt turned to
<pb facs="tcp:191458:37"/> 
                  <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaied, Sir Knight; let vs yet trie one blow more, and I will quite you for this time. You might content your ſelfe (ſaid hée) with that is done, but ſéeing you are ſo void of reaſon, I am content to trie it with you, till one of vs bee beaten off his horſe. Then he ſent <hi>Sergil</hi> to fetch another lance, and he brought him one ſome what bigger and ſhorter then thoſe hee had before, wherewith hee ſtrooke the knight of the forreſt ſo valiantly, that he ouerthrew him, himſelf being conſtrained to imbrace his horſe about the necke, or elſe he had fallen as the other did that lay on the ground, yet he roſe before <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had runne out his courſe and as he returned barke, he ſtaied him by the armour and ſaied vnto him, Before God ſir knight, you haue ſufficiently ſhewed that in valour and Proweſſe you are ſecond to none but to your ſelfe: but hee anſwered not a word, but holding downe his head (aſhamed of that had happened vnto him) paſſed forth. With that the king came thether to knowe what knights they were that had ben ouerthrowne, among the which he knew <hi>Galaor,</hi> for hee had put off his helmet to do him honour when he ſaw him come, wherat the king was ſo well pleaſed, that he alighted of his horſe and ranne to imbrace him, the like did <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſaying vnto him, with a ſmiling countenaunce, How now brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> how long haue you vſed to be a kéeper of the high waies? You ſée (ſaid hee) that I and my companions haue ſought to trie whether this knight be of ſuch force as we haue found him, and what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened you may well iudge, when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> vnderſtood his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Galaor</hi> (fearing to haue offended) hee lighted off his horſe, and knéeling downe before him, aſked pardon for his fault. Nephew (ſaied hée) it is I that haue done the wrong, and therefore I tolde the king that you are a better knight then I, and maruaile not if I ſought to prooue it, Becauſe I thought to doe it with mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but I found the contrary, which from henceforth ſhal make me thinke the things foreſhewed of you will bee accompliſhed ſo well, that the glory of your father, and the reputation by many knights in times paſt obtained, ſhall from henceforth bee extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, you hauing ſo eaſily ouerthrowne thrée of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt knights in great Brittaine, and my ſelfe the fourth. What are they (ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:191458:37"/> the king?) My lord (ſaid <hi>Galaor</hi>) the firſt that ranne was <hi>Sendale</hi> of <hi>Gonaſte,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Galuanes,</hi> the third <hi>Angriote d'eſtrauaulx,</hi> and my ſelfe hath done worſe then they. Wherat the king and al the company began to laugh: And imbracing them, cauſed them to mount on horſebacke, riding towards London, where in the way the King praied them to tell him howe this enterpriſe was deuiſed. My Lord (ſaied <hi>Galaor</hi>) hauing vnderſtoode by the daniſh Gentlewoman (that my lady <hi>Oriane</hi> not long ſince ſent vnto the Quéene, to bring her newes of your returne, and what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto you during your impriſonment) the valiant acts by you declared of my nephew <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> wee conceiued ſuch a iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie againſt him, eſtéeming the honour you did him thereby, to procéed rather of fatherly loue then otherwiſe, that wée determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſecretly to depart out of London to proue his force, as now you haue well ſéene: and to moue him therevnto, we ſent the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman with the meſſage you haue heard. Of my faith (ſaied the king) the deuiſe was good, and hath fallen out well. In this manner deuiſing of ſundry things, hee came to Mirefleur, where the Quéen met him, praiſing God for his vnexpected return, and conſidering his trouble paſt, with the gréefe ſhee had for his long abſence, ſéeing him there ſafe and in good health, ſhee thought her ſelfe well recompenced with his preſence. The next day in the morning they ſet forwards towards London, where the people receiued him with ſuch ſigns of gladneſſe, that moſt part of them wept for ioy to ſée him, for there was neuer Prince better loued of his ſubiects the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he. Being there, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> began to be weary of the place, longing to heare news of <hi>Carmelle,</hi> that he had ſent to Conſtantinople, as you haue heard before. And therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day hee deuiſed meanes to get licence to depart from thence, pretending a cauſe of returning to the caſtle called <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> ſhewing the king what promiſe he had made to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, which if hee did not performe, they ſhould haue cauſe to complaine of him, but the king would not in any ſort graunt to his requeſt, yet in the end, ouercome with much importunity, he was content, wherewith hee tooke his leaue of all the court, and vpon a monday in the morning taking horſe, accompanied onely
<pb facs="tcp:191458:38"/> of maiſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Sergil</hi> his ſquire, hee tooke his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ferme Iſle, hoping to finde the great Serpent there, wherein they might imbarke themſelues.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Splandian</hi> departed from the king, and hauing taken his leaue of all the court, as you heard before, tooke the crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt way hee could, through woods and forreſts towards the Ferme Iſie, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king not to bee perceiued of any, that might hinder his enterpriſe. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ridden thrée miles, he entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forreſt, which hauing almoſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hée came vnto a great riuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherevpon the king had built a houſe, called Belleroſe, where oftentimes being on hunting, hee vſed to reſort. And as he thought to paſſe the bridge, he perceiued on the other ſide a knight armed at all points ready to fight, that cried vnto him with a loud voice, and ſaid: Sir knight, you muſt aſke me leaue if you wil come ouer, for according to my promiſe, I haue taken vpon mee to kéepe this bridge, for the ſpace of one whole yeare, wherefore if you thinke good, you may take ſome other way. With that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was much gréeued, perceiuing that either of force he muſt fight, or ſéeke another paſſage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would willingly haue excuſed himſelfe, &amp; ſaid: Sir knight, I pray you then ſhew mee which way I were beſt to goe, for by me you ſhall haue no cauſe at this time to trouble your ſelfe. You muſt returne again to London (ſaid he) for other paſſage is there none, vnleſſe you will looſe your horſe and goe on foot. Rather the I would doe ſo (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I will proue if I can win yours, and therewith lacing his helmet, tooke his launce and road vnto the knight, who no ſooner perceiued him comming, but ſetting
<pb facs="tcp:191458:38"/> ſpurres to his horſe, ranne towards him, whereby they met ſo fiercely together, that both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights fell off their horſes, in ſuch manner, that maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Sergil,</hi> thought verily they had ſlaine each other, but they ſtaied not long before they roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and laying hand on their ſwordes, there began betwéene them the cruelleſt and moſt daungerous battell that euer was ſéene: whereat maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> much abaſhed, ſaid vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Good God, what may this meane, I beléeue for certain that ſome diuell of hell hath tranſformed himſelfe into humane ſhape, to deſtroy vs all. Meane time the two knights continued in moſt cruell fight, ſtill increaſing their mights, cleauing ſhields and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, in ſuch ſort, that all the field was couered with péeces of the harneis, and died with blood that iſſued from their bodies, till at the laſt the knight of the bridge ſtept backe &amp; ſaid vnto <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> Sir knight, take another way, and I am content to quite you of the combate, for you are the valianteſt knight that euer I dealt withall, and it ſhould diſpleaſe mee much, if by your wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you would be cauſe of your owne death. In good faith (ſaied he) I had done it at the firſt, had it not beene, the feare I had, that you would eſtéeme me a coward, but knowing very wel that the honour of this combate cannot bee had, but onely by the death of one of vs, or both together, I will trie my fortune, till I bee no longer able to weld a ſword. Is that true (ſaid the knight?) Then let vs ſée to whom fortune will be fauourable. And therewith co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering themſelues with that little of their ſhields that reſted in their hands, they began the combate crueller then before, as though all the day they had not giuen a ſtroke, ſo that after many cruel blowes with their ſwords, they cloſed together, and wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling long time, they ſought to caſt each other to the ground. But ſéeing the little aduantage gotten thereby, they began againe to lay on with their ſwords with ſuch fury, that <hi>Sergil</hi> looked for no other but when they ſhould fall dead vpon the ground, not béeing able to iudge who would haue the victory. Whereat maiſter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> was ſo much diſpleaſed, that hee could not abſtaine from wéeping, ſaying vnto himſelfe, Alas what fortune is this, muſt the beſt knight liuing in the world, and in the flower of his age
<pb facs="tcp:191458:39"/> loſe his life at that time by ſo hard a chaunce? Curſed be the day that euer he met with him, that is the cauſe of ſo great loſſe. And to ſay truth, if God had not prouided for them, the father had ſlain the ſonne, and the ſonne the father, for the knight of the bridge was <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> who being ouer curious of his ſonnes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would proue his force, and the better to doe it, the day before <hi>Eſplandian</hi> tooke his leaue, hee departed ſecretly from the court, and ſtaied for him at the bridge, bearing an vnknowne armour, where after many attempts on either part giuen, <hi>Amadis</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing both their dangers, ſaid vnto <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> Knight, you ſée well you cannot ouercome mee, and I aſſure you, I neuer had to doe with any knight, that euer put mee to ſo great extreamity, wherefore I am content to let you paſſe.

Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> called him vnto them, meane time <hi>Amadis</hi> put off his helmet, ſo faint and weary, that hée was conſtrained to leane vnto a trée.

And continuing in that gréefe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood in diuers places ranne out of his body, whereby he waxed faint, which maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> perceiuing, and knowing aſſuredly, if remedy were not ſpéedily had, they were both in danger of their liues, hee ſaied vnto them: I pray you for this time leaue off your ſorrow, and let vs preſently go to Mirefleur, not far from hence, for you both haue greater néede of reſt, then of longer ſtaying in

Such was the combate betwéene the two knights as you haue heard, yet ſome write, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo wounded by <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that in the end with a thruſt of a launce into the right ſhoulder, and other blowes with his ſword, hee was ſlaine in the field, which <hi>Oriane</hi> hearing, threw her ſelfe out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and brake her necke. But it is not true, for they raigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that both in Fraunce and great Brittaine, and had another ſonne named <hi>Perion,</hi> and a doughter no leſſe beautifull then her mother, that married <hi>Arquiſil</hi> ſonne to the Emperour of Rome. But I cannot conceiue from whence thoſe lyers could inuent ſuch a thing, if they vnderſtand not by (death) the ſhadowes that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> cauſed his fathers valiant acts to bee couered withall, by the light and pleaſant ſhining of his owne, wherby his fathers were ſo much had in obliuion, that there was no more brute of them, then if they had neuer beene done. But to returne againe vnto our matter, you muſt note that newes went preſently vnto the court, what had chanced to the two knights. Wherewith the king and <hi>Oriane</hi> much diſpleaſed, departed from London, &amp; came to Mirefleur, when maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began the ſecond time to dreſſe their wounds. Whereby he perceiued them out of danger, and cured them ſo well, that within ſeuen daies after they could walke about the chamber, which put <hi>Oriane</hi> in better comfort then before, and it fell out well for her, for if her malancholy had longer indured ſhe had for certain died at that time. And becauſe the king had not as yet vnderſtoode the reaſon that mooued them to fight, one day when hee found <hi>Amadis</hi> in good diſpoſition, hee praied him to tell him. In faith my lord (ſaied hee) I was deſirous to haue the difference of our two forces knowne, being aſſured, that whatſoeuer chaunced thereby, it could not bee but to mine honour: for if my ſonne bee a better knight then my ſelfe, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the preſent time, will increaſe my glory paſt. Before God (ſaied the king) your enterpriſe was but raſhly vndertaken, I pray you another time let vs leaue ſuch youthfull partes for thoſe that are but entring into arms. Beléeue me, and it pleaſeth
<pb facs="tcp:191458:40"/> your grace (ſaied hée) I was neuer better beaten in all my life. It is no matter (ſaied the king) ſéeing you haue both eſcaped with your liues, now ſéeke meanes to bée healed of your wounds with as much ſpéede as you may, and from henceforth let vs war only againſt Harts and other wild beaſts that are within this forreſt, as my huntſmen haue ſhewed me this day.</p>

And as they went néerer vnto it, they heard one among the reſt that ſaid vnto her, Ha, thou falſe and accurſed wretch, thy diuelliſh ſpirits and familiars can now no longer helpe thée, but at this time thou ſhalt ſurely die. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Manely</hi> and <hi>Garinter</hi> had their helmets on their heads,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:40"/> yet the woman they ſo threatened, knew them well, calling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſaid: Help me my ſonnes, and faile me not I pray you at this time. With that <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of Denmarke knew her by her voice, wherefore laying hands on their ſwords, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the tenne knights, wherof one of them ſtepped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt, aſking them if they knew that wicked woman that had done him the greateſt miſchiefe that euer was. By God ſir knight (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) you lie in your throat, ſhe is not wicked, but faithfuller for her part, then you for yours. Wherewith they ran each vpon other, and there began the combate of tenne knights againſt two, and although the match was not equall, <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of Denmarke ſetting their backes together, laied valiantly vpon them, yet in the end they could not haue reſiſted, but <hi>Vrganda</hi> playing her part, put out the fire, and taking her two knights aſide, left the reſt in the darke, ſtriking each other as if <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of Denmarke had beene with them. Meane time <hi>Vrganda</hi> and her company got into the thicket of the wood, and hauing trauailed long, at the laſt the moone began to ſhine, when they were weary, whereby they determined to ſtay a while and reſt themſelues till day appeared. Meane time the two knights deſired <hi>Vrganda</hi> to ſhewe them how ſhee came thether, and whether ſhe knew the country. My good friends (ſaid ſhe) hauing long ſince learned by my art, that this little child ſon to the Emperour of Rome, and of the Empreſſe <hi>Leonor</hi> his wife, ſhould bee ſtollen away by the Traitor that aſſailed you, who is ſonne to <hi>Garadan,</hi> that <hi>Amadis</hi> (as then called the knight of the gréene ſword) put to death in the countrey of Bohemia, in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the right of king <hi>Tafmor:</hi> As ſoone as you fell on ſléepe in the great Serpent, I made al the haſt I could vnto this place to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it, according to my promiſe made (being in the Ferme Iſle) in preſence of <hi>Amadis</hi> and diuers other knights, where I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at ſo good a time when the villaines which you ſaw, came to a ſhepheards houſe, where a poore nurſe dwelt, to whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered this little child to giue it ſucke. And ſéeing it was time to put my enterpriſe in practiſe, I went out of my barke, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as if I had ben robbed by certaine théeues, ranne towards
<pb facs="tcp:191458:41"/> them, crying out and wéeping bitterly, wherewith they all came forth to ſée what it might be, and perceiuing me in that manner, aſked the cauſe of my gréefe. Ha my lords (ſaid I) It is ſo, that as my huſband &amp; I paſſed through this wood, wée met eight théeues, that ſlew him, and not content therewith, haue taken away my horſe and my budget, wherein there is a great ſumme of money. Which they beléeuing to bee true, (not that they were mooued with compaſſion for my loſſe) but reſpecting their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefite, hoping to get a booty by them that had robbed mee, ſcattered themſelues in companies to find them out, where they ſtaied ſo long, that the ſhéepheard and his wife went out of the houſe, and thinking to haue their parts, left mee alone with the child, that not long after I tooke in mine armes, and went away. But as it fell out, the nurſe came in, and miſſing the child, called to them for help, who running in great haſt, followed mée ſo faſt, (that had it not ben for night that ouertooke them) and the great fire you found about mee, I had neuer eſcaped their hands. And what would they haue done with this poore infant (ſaid <hi>Manely?</hi>) You ſhall vnderſtand (ſaid ſhe) that the ſonne of <hi>Garadan</hi> hauing conceiued a mortal hatred againſt the Emperour, either becauſe he could not haue the entertainement hee thought hee had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or elſe gréeued (as I thinke) that hee could not attaine vnto the Empire, as hee pretended: determined not onely to reuenge himſelfe vpon this little child, but to kill the Emperour likewiſe if euer he haue the means. By God (ſaid the king of Denmark) hée is a wicked and cruell hearted man, but aſſure your ſelfe that God wil not permit it to be ſo. Neuertheleſſe I am in doubt this child will indure much woe, ſéeing you haue no meanes to giue it ſucke. Let me alone with that (ſaid <hi>Vrganda</hi>) for I haue certain hearbes about me, with the iuice wherof I will nouriſh it, if néed be eight daies together. What (ſaied hee) will you then ſtay here ſo long? No (ſaid <hi>Vrganda</hi>) for as ſoone as it is day I will returne vnto my boat that ſtaieth here at the ſhoare. But madame (ſaied they) what ſhal become of vs? for we are arriued here, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who brought vs hether. But for Gods ſake, if you haue heard any newes of our companions, let vs knew it, and where wee

My friends (ſaid ſhee) you muſt firſt let de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteny haue his courſe, and indure many hard aduentures, &amp; when time ſerueth you ſhall haue your deſires. And in that manner ſometimes talking and ſometimes ſléeping, they paſſed the time away till day began to appeare, when they thrée together went to the ſea ſide, where they entered into <hi>Vrgandas</hi> boat, wherein foure Gentlewomen and two dwarfes ſtaied for her.</p>

And that which abaſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt was, that night comming vpon them, it was ſo darke, they could not ſée the length of their boat, in which torment they continued for the ſpace of thirty daies together, till at the length it caſt them vpon an Iſland, where (being arriued about ſunne ſetting) they landed. Then commaunding one of their ſquires to kéepe their boat, being armed at all points, they went into the Iſland to ſée if they could find any freſh water or other victuals, for they had not ſufficient in their barke to ſerue them for a wéeke, at the laſt they found a goodly fountaine, ſhadowed with many great trées, whereby they ſat them downe, and putting off their helmets for to drinke, <hi>Argenton</hi> their ſquire that was with them, ſaied vnto them: if you thinke good, gou ſhall ſtay here while I goe vp this high rocke, where (it may be) I ſhal find a houſe, or ſome country man that will ſhew vs in what place we are arriued? Goe (ſaied the king of Denmarke) but take héede thou looſeſt not thy ſelfe.
<pb facs="tcp:191458:43"/> With that the ſquire left them, and tooke his way through the wood, but he had not gone a long bowes ſhot, when he perceaued a great Beare comming towards him, wherewith hee was in ſuch feare, that with a lowd voice he cried out for helpe, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no other remedy, hee was conſtrained to climbe into a high trée. The knights hearing their ſquires crie, ſuppoſed he had néed of them, and with that they ranne in ſuch haſt to helpe him, that forgetting their helmets behind them, left them by the fountain, and they had not runne farre, but they eſpied the Bear climbing againſt the trée, wherein the Squire was defending himſelfe as well as he could, but the beaſt forſaking her firſt pray, ranne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Manely,</hi> being next vnto her, thinking at the firſt encounter to throw him on the ground, but he ſtepping aſide, gaue her ſuch a blow with his ſword, that therewith he cut off one of her eares with a péece of her iaw, but the Beare turned again, and taking him moſt fiercely about the body thought to ſtrangle him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had almoſt loſt his breath, when the king of Denmarke came vnto her, and with one blow cut one of her legs clean from the body, whereby the beaſt in great anguiſh forſaking her pray, fled into the thicket of the wood, and the king after her, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had followed, had it not ben for the waight of his armor, that wearied him ouermuch, wherefore returning againe vnto his companion, they two help their Squire <hi>Argenton</hi> to come down the trée, who as yet for feare trembled like a leafe, whereat they both began to laugh, <hi>Manely</hi> aſking him if he were a cold, no (ſaid he) but I was in the greateſt feare that euer I had in all my life, or euer I hope ſhall haue againe, and ſurely I beléeue there are no other people in this Iſland, then diuels diſguiſed in ſtraunge formes, or elſe ſuch proper Gentlewomen, as ſhe that of late im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced you ſo courteouſly, wherefore I am of this opinion, that for our better ſecurity, it were beſt for vs to ſtay by the fountain, or in our barke till the ſea bee ſomewhat pacefied. In truth thou ſaieſt well (ſaied the king of Denmarke) but in the meane time bee thou of a good courage and feare nothing, I knowe not what courage I ſhould haue (ſaied he) but I pray you for Gods ſake let vs be gone, vnleſſe you will ſée me die here.

In which manner talking together, they came vnto the fountaine, where they eſpied two old apes caſting their helmets (they had left behind them) one at the other, as lightly as if they had been at Tenniſe, whereat the two knights and <hi>Argenton</hi> laughed ſo hartely, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ouercome with laughter: for the apes had no ſooner ſpied them comming, but in great haſt they put the helmets on their heads, and climbing vp the trées, ſkipped from branch to branch, ſometimes vp and ſometimes down, like two tumblers. As God helpe me (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) I like theſe apes well, for they knew wée were ſo melancholy on the ſea, that they meant to make vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on land, yet I truſt they ſhall not carry away my arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a combate. Wherewith they tooke vp ſtones and threw at them, but they turning about, grinned with their téeth, making mouths and mowes, ſometimes ſcratching their arſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the king of Denmarke tooke ſuch pleaſure, that hee deſired <hi>Manely</hi> and <hi>Argenton</hi> to let the apes alone, and as then it began to be night. Wherefore they ſent their ſquire to fetch his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with the reſt of the victuals they had in their barke, becauſe the ſea roſe ſo high, that they doubted their barke would bee caſt on ſhoare, and breake in péeces, who ſtaied not long before they came againe, and after the knights had eaten of ſuch victuals as they had, they put off their armour, and ſlept till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when they awaked, finding their helmets lying by them, but not their armour, for thoſe newe men of warre had put them on ſo properly, that by their countenaunces it ſéemed they had ſome great combate to fight one againſt the other, in the top of the high elmes, whereof there were great plenty. But that ſport liked not the two knights, that were loath to die in that place for want of food, but made their account, either to put themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto the mercy of the waues, or elſe goe further into the Iſland to ſéeke meat. Wherfore making bowes of wood, which they ſtringed with their garters, and cutting arrowes to them, ſharpe at the points, they ſhot at thoſe woody champions ſo long,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:44"/> that at the laſt they compelled them to ſkip downe, whereby they tooke them, and pulled off their armor, which done, they let them goe, not doing them any hurt.</p>

But not long after they changed their opinion, <hi>Carmelle</hi> beginning to ſpeak in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. My lord, I haue beene nouriſhed all my life among the beſt knights liuing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, yet let not your grace find it ſtrange, if at the firſt (being in your maieſties preſence) I haue vſed ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honour to your grace, whereby your Gentlemen ſhould haue cauſe to laugh at mee: For that want of vnderſtanding howe to behaue my ſelfe in preſence of ſo great a Prince is not the cauſe thereof, but onely the ioy I conceiue in my ſelfe, to bee a ſeruant vnto him, whom I more eſtéeme then any man liuing: and I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold for my lord and maiſter, not knowing any worthier then he. And if it pleaſeth your grace to know who it is, together with the cauſe of my arriuall in this countrey, I pray you ſend for the two knights that brought mée hether, &amp; I will ſhew ſuch things, whereat (it may be) your grace will be abaſhed. Gentlewoman (ſaied the Emperour) you ſhall therein doe mee great pleaſure. Wherewith hee commanded a Gentleman to goe fetch the two ſtraunge knights, who comming into the Emperours preſence, hauing kiſſed his handes, and he welcommed them in courteous manner, he willed two chaires to bee brought, wherein hee ſet them, being a Prince that alwaies entertained ſtraungers with great honour, eſpecially if hee knew them to be of forraine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. That done, all the knights, Gentlewomen, and ladies went néere to heare the Gentlewomans ſpéech, when ſhee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the Emperour, ſaid in this manner: My lord, I thinke your grace hath long before this time knowne the caſtle, called <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> the which (during the life of valiant <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadaque,</hi> and ſince that time) you and the king of Turkie haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers time aſſailed to winne, although in vaine, it hath alwaies been ſo well defended by the Giants <hi>Matroco</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> yet in one day a knight alone hath conquered it, &amp; ſlain the two giants
<pb facs="tcp:191458:45"/> whereof I ſpake, with their vncle <hi>Arcalaus</hi> and <hi>Argantes</hi> the Porter of the ſame. And which is more, hath deliuered king <hi>Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,</hi> that lay priſoner therein, no man knowing it, for hée had ben ſurpriſed in great Brittaine, and ſecretly brought from thence by <hi>Arcabonne</hi> lady of the caſtle: The which lady falling in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, threw her ſelfe out of a window into the ſea. And to the end your grace may knowe how all hath happened: it is ſo (ſaied ſhee) that <hi>Arcabonne</hi> (who as then I ſerued) hauing intelligence of her brothers impriſonment in the Ferme Iſle, departed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely from the caſtle, hoping to deliuer him, but before ſhe got thether, he was ſet at liberty. Notwithſtanding (ſhe being loth to looſe her labour) to bee reuenged thereof, did ſo much by her art, that ſhe got king <hi>Luiſart</hi> (as then hunting in the forreſt) into her tent, the king thinking to ſuccour a Gentlewoman, that as hee thought a knight would haue defloured: where he was ſo cruelly inchaunted, that loſing all his ſences, hee was tranſported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mans knowledge into the dungeon of the caſtle, where my lord and maiſter found him. And continuing her diſcourſe, ſhe ſhewed in what manner <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was made knight, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to find the king, hée was carried by the boat of the great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent into the Iſle of the Enchauntreſſe, where he conquered the ſhining ſword, and after that brought in a little barke to the foote of the rocke called <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> the ſpéech hee had with the Hermite, the combates with <hi>Argantes, Matroco,</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> the deſperateneſſe of <hi>Arcabonne,</hi> the determination ſhe had to kil him, when ſhe found him ſléeping in the hermitage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was ſodainly ſurpriſed.

At the leaſt, we will make him ſo good cheare, and my doughter likewiſe, to whome I giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement to doe it, that hee ſhall not haue occaſion to diſlike our company. Mean time the two knights ſhal remain with vs for pledges, aſſuring you I will giue them all the honor and good intertainement that I can deuiſe. My lord (ſaid ſhee) the deſire they had to vnderſtand the things declared to your grace, hath cauſed them for to come hether, with whome by great good fortune I met, for <hi>Frandalo,</hi> whom he (pointing to <hi>Manely</hi>) hath moſt valiantly conquered, had taken mee priſoner, not farre off from the place where I firſt imbarked: but as fortune would, there roſe ſo great a ſtorme at ſea, that all his veſſels ſeperated one from the other, his ſhip was caſt vpon an Iſland, wherein (by the ſame tempeſt) theſe two knights not long before arriued. And with that ſhee ſhewed what ſpéech they had with <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and what paſſed betwéene them: Wherefore my lord, acquiting my promiſe made vnto them, I haue at large declared the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the good knight their companion. In faith (ſaied the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) they haue ſhewed themſelues right valiant knights, and made a worthy preſent vnto my doughter, for which I giue them thankes. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Manely</hi>) wée humbly beſéech your grace, that from henceforth you will accept his ſeruice, for it is his only deſire, as he hath promiſed vs. Is that poſſible (ſaied the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?) For he is the vildeſt villaine that euer liued on earth, and hath more wronged my ſubiects then euer any did. My lord (ſaied the king of Denmarke) he will become a new man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my companion did preſent him to your daughter, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for to ſaue his life, which we beſéech your grace likewiſe to performe.

They that beheld it were thereat abaſhed, ſpecially the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Squires, who preſently began to flie, but they had not run farre, when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ouertooke them, threatning to ſlay them if they would not ſhewe him the place where their maiſter kept his priſoners, which they promiſed to do. And leading him along by the foot of the hill from whence hee had deſcended, they came into a narrow way full of ſtones, where ſtood a watch of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men all armed, each man with a hatchet in his hand to defend the paſſage.

But he had ſo many men about him, that in the end his horſe was ſlaine, and he in danger to be ouerthrown. Yet hee behaued himſelfe ſo valiantly, and with ſo great a courage, that hee remained victor, his enemies flying as faſt as poſſibly they might: and among the reſt, the laquie that he found kéeping the foure horſes, who ſauing himſelfe in a vaut, cried with a loud voice and ſaied, Come forth my lord, come forth, your ſonne <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> is ſlaine, and all our companions likewiſe. With that there appeared a great old Giant with a long white beard, who ſéeing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his ſword bloody in his hand, and moſt of his men lying dead about him, he caſt out a great ſigh and ſaid, O immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods, wherein haue I ſo much offended you, that you ſhould ſuffer my only ſonne and all my men to be ſlaine in ſuch manner by this one knight?

Whereat the Giant was in ſuch a rage, that caſting downe his ſhield, tooke the péece of his ſword in both his hands, and with all his force ſtrooke at <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that ſtept aſide, and perceiuing the Giants arme comming towards him, with one blow cut off his hand, whereby his ſword fell downe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he ſéemed not abaſhed, but imbracing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his left arme, thought to cruſh the breath out of his body, but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened otherwiſe, for as hee held him, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hauing his right arme at libertie, thruſt his ſword into the Giants body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he died.

In that manner they paſſed the reſt of the day in the great Serpent, minding the next day becauſe ſhée ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to take land againe to ſée if they could finde any more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures: And they had ſcarſe fallen aſléepe, but the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of it ſelfe to ſaile forward ſo ſwiftly, that by ſunne riſing they had loſt the ſight of any land, not ceaſing for to ſaile ſixe daies together before they eſpied land: the ſeuenth day when the ſunne began to ſhine, it ſtaied at the Iſle Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> which maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preſently knew, as hauing ben there before with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaule,</hi> when he fought with <hi>Landriaque:</hi> wherefore he ſaied
<pb facs="tcp:191458:53"/> vnto the knights. In good faith, I remember that once as I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed on the ſea with my lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> wee were caſt vpon this Iſland by ſo great a tempeſt, that we thought verily to haue béen drowned. And if then at ſea wee had great feare of death, béeing landed, our feare did more increaſe, and that with ſo good cauſe, that I cannot chuſe but tremble to remember it. What (ſaied <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplandian?</hi>) Can a danger ſo long time paſt bréed ſo great a feare as you ſéeme to haue? Sir (ſaied maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) ſome men to hide the truth, make a great matter of a ſmall, but if you had ſéen as much as I then ſaw, and that which as yet you may behold, if it pleaſeth you to goe where I was once, you ſhall find that I haue no leſſe occaſion, and there is <hi>Gandalin</hi> that can witneſſe it as wel as I. I pray you bring vs thether (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) with that they cauſed the horſes to be vnſhipt, and going to land, they mounted vp the Iſland, til they came to the caſtle where <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtaied certain daies to be healed of his wounds, where they found a knight that kept it forthe Emperour, who being aduertiſed by maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> what knights they were hee had brought thether, bad them heartely welcome, offering them all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he could ſhew, but they ſtaying not there, went forwards to the place where <hi>Amadis</hi> fought with <hi>Landriaque,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had erected both their Images ſo like vnto them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there wanted only life to expreſſe the ſame: Which maiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhewed vnto the knights, and to the end (ſaid he) you beléeue mee better another time, I pray you behold well the forme of this great diuell, who before my lord <hi>Amadis</hi> arriued had vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied this moſt fertile Iſland. And therewith hee ſhewed them from point to point what had paſſed touching the ſame, as you haue heard at large ſet downe in the third booke of this our hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereat they were all abaſhed, eſpecially to think how <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaque</hi> could bee ſlaine or ouercome by one knight alone. For although this image were but a ſenceleſſe thing, yet it made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abaſhed, which hauing long time beheld, and viſiting other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces worthy memory, they returned to the great Serpent, which preſently departed from the Iſle, and with a good winde, in fiue daies after arriued within half a mile of Conſtantinople, where
<pb facs="tcp:191458:53"/> it began to caſt forth fire in ſo furious manner, that the ſaylers and others that perceiued it, fled all away, doubting the fury of that monſter, wherewith the Cittizens were in ſuch a feare, that newes was brought vnto the Emperour, who as then was talking with the ladies, whom he led vnto the towers of his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to ſée what it might be, when they perceiued the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the ſea raging ſo ſore about it, that it ſéemed a gulfe of fire, wherewith they were in ſuch a feare, and the Emperour likewiſe, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded al men to be armed, fearing it would come into the Towne, and ſo deſtroy them al. But <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> that had ſéene it oftentimes, aſſured the Emperour that it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhip of the knight <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> which <hi>Vrganda</hi> brought firſt into great Brittaigne. And to the end my lord (ſaied hee) you ſhall not doubt thereof, if it pleaſeth you I will goe ſée if the ſonne of <hi>Amadis</hi> be there, and bring him vnto you. Doe ſo I pray you (ſaied the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.) With that <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtilles</hi> went vnto the Hauen, entring into a Gally that hee found ready to put to ſea, commanding the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereof to row vnto the great Serpent, but whatſoeuer hee could ſay, the maiſter would not ſtirre one foote, till ſuch time hee threatned him with feare of being hanged. Wherefore hoiſing vp his anker, the company began to row forward, but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to come neare the Serpent by a good bow ſhot, and withall the ſea it was ſo hie, that the waues caſt them backe againe into the Hauen with ſo great a force, that the Gally was in danger to bee caſt away. Which the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, (who till then thought aſſuredly <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come thether for to ſée her) began to deſpaire of her good hope, and making her complaint, ſaied vnto her ſelfe: Alas monſter, ſhip, Gally, or what veſſell ſoeuer thou art, wherefore art thou now ſo cruell vnto me, in not ſuffering him that is within thée to land at this our Hauen, to the end mine eies might enioy his preſence, but rather as if thou haddeſt conceiued a iealouſie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, thou vſeſt all meanes poſſible to hinder the ſhip wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my couſin <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſaileth, not to approch neare thee, that hee might bring him hether, or at the leaſt that wée might hear ſome newes of him. But in faith, all well waied and conſidred, I think
<pb facs="tcp:191458:54"/> thee rather to haue reaſon, and my ſelfe without conſideration, for that ſo excellent a thing ought not to bee ſo lightly ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Therefore it is no meruaile if thou refuſe him vnto vs, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt thou ſhouldeſt looſe him, ſéeing thou maiſt well vaunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thée there reſteth ſo valerous knight, as in regard of him all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be nought eſtéemed. I would to God, that wee being both together, might neuer depart out of thy body: for being with him, his only preſence would bréed in mée ſo much contentment, that I ſhould thinke my ſelfe to haue attained vnto the top of all felicity: and if his loue bee ſuch as <hi>Carmelle</hi> hath aſſured mee, it cannot be, but that he ſuffereth the like paſſion I now indure, by ouermuch deſire to ſée his perſon. Wherewith ſhee remained in ſuch an extaſie, that by the changing of her colour, it might eaſily be iudged her heart was not at eaſe, which in the end compelled her to ſigh: and at the ſame inſtant to repent the ſpéeches ſhe had vſed vnto <hi>Carmelle,</hi> as alſo of the rich gowne that ſhe gaue vnto her. For (ſaid ſhe vnto her ſelfe) what know I, if my ſwéet friend ſéeing her apparrelled therin, would imbrace her, not for the loue of her, but for the gowne that once belonged vnto mee. And if it be ſo, it is not to bee doubted, but ſhee will by all meanes ſéeke to ioine her lips to his, yea and her body like wiſe: which would bee worſe, ſéeing ſhe is neither ſo euill fauoured nor of ſo bad behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but it may be in a heat he would both forget himſelfe and me. But out alas what ſaid I? Truly I doe him wrong to bée ſo iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him, conſidering the chaſt loue that is betwéene them both, and therefore if it ſo fall out, that in reſpect of mee hee ſhall imbrace her body, beholding her apparrelled in a thing that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerued me, it will bee much more glory vnto me till I my ſelfe may once imbrace his body, as in time I doubt not but I ſhall. But if <hi>Leonorine</hi> were in paine, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had no leſſe, both ſollicited with like iealouſie, for the great diſtruſt of their not méeting at that time: and gladly would haue approched née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to each other, had it not béene that the one was on land vnder the gouernement of another man, the other at ſea within a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which he could not command. In the meane time the great Serpent ſetting forwards, made ſuch ſpéede, that in very ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:191458:54"/> ſpace it paſſed the ſtraights of Boſphore. Wherewith the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> was like to ſound, but ſhée refrained it as much as poſſible ſhee might, fearing to manifeſt that, ſhe moſt deſired to kéepe ſecret. Whereby ſhe withdrew her ſelfe halfe dead into her chamber, and making as if ſhe deſired to ſléepe, threwe her ſelfe on her bed, commanding her Gentle women to depart the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: they being gone, ſhe began againe to renue her ſorrow, and almoſt drowned in teares, ſaid vnto her ſelfe: Alas, now I ſurely ſée and well perceiue my gréefe to be wholly without remedy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſéene the thing (that in all the world I moſt intirely loue) ſo néere vnto me, and at one inſtant ſo ſuddainly to depart, that it is vncertaine whether he is gone. Ha cruell torment that ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in me ſo couertly, is it poſſible that from henceforth I can ſo well diſſemble as yet I haue done? Truly no, for if in time paſt I inforced my ſelfe to eſtéeme the deſire I had a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pleaſure vnto mee, nowe ſéeing I well perceiue my accurſed fortune to approch, and my ioy to fade, in manner as ſoone as it was conceiued, I deſire nought but death: which to me would be more acceptable, then liue in ſo great paine, not hoping any eaſe. And leauing ſo, ſhee gaue ſo great a ſigh, that Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> heard it: Who fearing ſhee had beene ſicke, opened the chamber dore, aſking her how ſhe did. Wherewith the Princeſſe percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that diſcouery, to excuſe her ſelfe the beſt ſhe could, ſhee told the Quéene ſhee dreamed. Madame (ſaied the Quéene) it is not long ſince the Empereſſe ſent to ſée what you were doing? Is it not your pleaſure to riſe and goe vnto her? Let vs goe (ſaied ſhee.) In the meane time <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his companions, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo long, that within two daies after they perceiued the rocke of <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> and not farre from them the veſſels and men of warre <hi>Frandalo</hi> had aſſembled, that ſtayed for a wind to ſurpriſe the Turkiſh Army on the ſea: who percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the great Serpent making towards them, began to arme themſelues, thinking that it had beene ſome monſter that came to deuour them. But <hi>Manely</hi> and the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke that had ſéene it oftentimes before, were very glad, giuing them to vnderſtand what ſuccours they might haue
<pb facs="tcp:191458:55"/> thereby, whereat they all reioiced, ſpecially when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Eſplandian, Gandalin,</hi> and the reſt, that <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of Denmarke knew, wherefore cauſing a boat to bee made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they with <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Argenton,</hi> the king of Denmarkes Squire (a very good marriner) entered into it, and rowing to the great Serpent, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> receiued them with great ioy, aſking <hi>Manely</hi> what fortune had brought them thether. In faith (ſaied he) it is not long ſince we departed from the citty of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, to diſcouer and to hinder the paſſage of victuals that are daily brought by ſea from the Towne of <hi>Norolia</hi> vnto <hi>Armato</hi> king of Turks, who not long ſithence hath beſieged the caſtle of <hi>La montaigne defendu:</hi> expecting daily the comming of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with a great army to driue the Turke from thence. But we haue had ſo contrary a wind, that it hath ben impoſſible for vs to effect our charge. In good truth (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) I would neuer haue ſought you in theſe countries, neither doe I knowe what became of you after wée fell aſléepe in this veſſell, I pray you tell it vs. Then <hi>Manely</hi> began to ſhew how he and the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke when they awaked found themſelues in a barke vpon the coaſt of Italy, where taking land they found <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and after that by cruell tempeſts they arriued in an Iſle, where a Beare aſſailed them, in which Iſle they ſaw two great apes that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them much ſport. But (ſaied hee) wee thought to haue ſtarued therein for want of meat, for our victuals were cleane conſumed when by fortune <hi>Frandalo</hi> arriued in the ſame Iſle, with whome I fought and ouercame him. And becauſe our barke was caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, wee entered into his, wherein wee found a Gentlewoman that told vs newes of you, whom for your ſake we conducted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſtantinople, and from thence haue brought her backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. As farre as I vnderſtand (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you haue not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſlept, and I beléeue that neuer any knight had fo ſtraunge aduentures at their firſt entering into armes vnleſſe it were my lord <hi>Amadis</hi> my father, which I would hardly haue beléeued, had it not ben for the ſignes and euident tokens that wee ſaw in the Iſle Saint <hi>Mary.</hi> What were they (ſaid the king of Denmark?) We ſaw the Image of <hi>Landriaque</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) with whome
<pb facs="tcp:191458:55"/> he had ſo long and perrillous a combate. It is true (ſaied <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>) that ſuch combates againſt monſters, doe oftentimes ſtrike the hardieſt knights with feare, and the combate of our Apes made ſorrowfull knights reioice. In good faith ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) thou haſt reaſon, and I like thée well for thy mirth, but I pray thée heartely returne againe, and fetch the Gentlewoman that is in thy maiſters ſhip, and bring her hether, that I may ſpeake with her, which he preſently did: and as ſhe entred into the great Serpent, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> imbracing her, aſked if ſhe had ſéene the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the beautifull Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> his doughter. I my lord (ſaid ſhe) both of them deſiring your arriual in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, eſpecially the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> with all the ladies and Gentlewomen, being fully determined not to pardon the great fault you haue committed in their behalfes, to haue deferred off ſo long before you come to ſerue them, according to the promiſe made by <hi>Amadis</hi> your father, as I aſſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet I thinke their diſpleaſure is not ſo great, but yee may well find meanes to pace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame. My good friend (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you are heartely welcome, wee will talke together when better leiſure ſerueth. Which he ſaid, fearing ſhe ſhould haue procéeded further, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſtanders by might haue intelligence of the loue he bare vnto the Princeſſe, wherefore leauing the Gentlewoman, and turning to <hi>Manely,</hi> hee ſaied: In faith I cannot well excuſe my ſelfe, but that I doe them wrong, for the firſt commaundement my father gaue mee at ſuch time I receiued the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was, that in his place I ſhould goe and ſerue them, to quit the promiſe he had made. Neuertheles fortune hath euer ſithence giuen mee ſo many croſſes thereby to hinder my intent, that I could neither fulfill his wil, nor ſatiſfie their expectations. While they were thus deuiſing, two of <hi>Frandalos</hi> Brigantines, that by him were ſent to eſpy the enemies nauy, brought news they had ſéene great numbers of their Foiſtes and Gallies ſailing to the Eaſt, to fetch victuals for the Nauie, and that the reſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind would eaſily bee ouercome, if it pleaſed them to ſet vpon them: which the knights vnderſtanding, were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that without longer delay they would aſſaile them, and
<pb facs="tcp:191458:56"/> preſently therewith hoiſed vp their ankers, making as ſecretly as they could towards <hi>Armatos</hi> fléete, yet they determined not to ſet vpon them before the breake of day, hoping to take them ſlée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which in truth fell out. The firſt that ſet vpon them was the great Serpent, that at her arriuall, entering among the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, caſt fire ſo fiercely at her mouth and noſthrils, that when they awaked it put them in ſuch feare, that loſing courage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtroke giuen, they all began to flie: Neuertheleſſe it could not ſaue their liues, but that the greateſt part of their veſſels were drowned by meanes of a contrary wind, that roſe ſo ſuddainely on the ſea, whereby it raged in ſuch ſort, that neither maſt, ſayle, bord, nor oare could holde, but were broken all in péeces: yet did not <hi>Frandalo</hi> loſe any of his fléet, neither did the camp once moue thereat, for they were not ſéene of any other then the ſentinell of the caſtle, that preſently told <hi>Ambor</hi> and <hi>Talanque,</hi> wherat they receiued great pleaſure, eſpecially when they eſpied the great Serpent and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Aſſure your ſelfe (ſaid he) it was not with our wils, but we defended it as long as poſſible wee might, and the Portaile like wiſe, which at their firſt comming they aſſailed. But we defended it ſo well, that without their mine they had neuer won it, yet did it profite them but little, for that ſodainly wee deſtroied all their mine, that had coſt them fiftéen daies labour. Which <hi>Armato</hi> perceiuing, ſought to begin againe, which we by diuers ſallies would not ſuffer him to doe: but whatſoeuer we could doe, in the end their force preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and wee conſtrained to forſake the ſame, and retire vnto the caſtle, and that in good time, for we were ſcarſe entered into the dungeon, but they fired it, whereby the Portall fell downe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs at that time one of the moſt cruell aſſaults that euer place ſuſtained, being ſo meanely guarded as it was, and aſſure your ſelfe, that there is neither loopehole nor window, but they raiſed ladders or ſome other engins againſt it, and with launces, fire, and ſword, gaue vs ſo much to doe, that we were in doubt to be ouercome. Neuertheleſſe they were as whotely repulſed, for <hi>Libee</hi> gaue them ſuch intertainement with a dramme of pouder, that hee ſet on fire, as they began to crie out victorie, but vpon a ſuddain their cry became ſo pittifull, that nothing but ſorrow and lamentation could be heard among them, where with there were ſo many of them burnt and ſinged, that neuer ſince they durſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch ſo néere, although wee haue giuen them diuers ſkirmiſhes, but for the ſpace of eight daies we neuer iſſued foorth, by reaſon (as you know) if wee ſhould often iſſue foorth, it is impoſſible but ſome of our men muſt of force bee ſlaine, and the death of one of ours would be more loſſe vnto vs then the ſlaying of a hundreth of their men would profite vs. You haue done well (ſaid <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) for all wiſe captaines ought to content themſelues with the ſure defending of a hold committed vnto them, not hazarding themſelues to loſſe as long as poſſible they may. But for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafetie of this caſtle, I thinke it good wee take counſell what were beſt to bee done, leaſt wee bee ſurpriſed.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:57"/> and (among diuers things propounded) it was concluded, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next night they would iſſue forth to ſlay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies watch, which would eaſily bee done, ſéeing they had not any alarme in long time before. Wherefore euery man went to refreſh himſelf, till about eleuen of the clocke at night, when <hi>Frandalo</hi> and the reſt armed themſelues. And as they were all aſſembled in the court, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſtanding in the middle, ſpake vnto them and ſaied, My good friendes, wee are not now among the combates of great Brittaigne, where combates are fought more for fantaſie, or vaine glory, then vpon any iuſt occaſion: But this warre wee make againſt the proper enemies of our faith, ſummoneth vs not onely to doe our indeuours, but alſo to defend the honour and liberty of the name of Chriſtians. Wherefore my good compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I beſéech you let euery man caſt feare aſide, preferring ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue before any inconuenience whatſoeuer. Aſſuring you (if wee doe ſo) that before it be day, king <hi>Armato</hi> and his army ſhall well find, we are not ſo fainthearted as he eſtéemeth vs. Then calling <hi>Norandel</hi> vnto him, he ſaid: Vncle, you, <hi>Manely</hi> and the king of Denmarke with a hundred men, ſhall iſſue firſt to flay the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, and if you could doe the like vnto their watch, our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe would bee brought to paſſe as wee deſire.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:57"/> they let them paſſe. Meane time <hi>Armato</hi> king of Turky ſate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing in his tent with his familiar friendes, touching the loſſe of ſhips, whereof not aboue an hower before, he had receiued news by one of his marriners, that ſaued himſelfe in a ſmall Frigate: but the Turke could not by any meanes imagine how it came to paſſe, ſéeing his ſpies that were newly returned from Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, had brought him newes that the Emperour ſtirred not, neither made any preparation to aſſaile him. And as <hi>Frandalo</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſplandian</hi> entred the tent, they heard the marriner tell how that cruell ouerthrow happened by meanes of a monſter of the ſea, that came with the enemies fléet. That (ſaied hee) put vs in ſuch fear, with caſting fire out of his mouth, noſe, and eies, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the moſt part of our men were burnt to aſhes. By all my gods (ſaid <hi>Armato</hi>) it is ſome diuell that enuieth my proſperitie. And it pleaſeth your grace ſaid one of his Baſſaes, (that had ſailed in the mediteranian ſeas, and heard ſpeaking of the great Serpent) there is nothing but art Magicke vſed therein, whereof I am moſt ſure, as hauing diuers times ben certefied thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they heard a great alarum, for <hi>Norandel</hi> and his company had iſſued out of the caſtle with white ſcarffes about their heads for to bee knowne, and had ſo well ſurpriſed the watch about the baſe court, that they had ſlaine them all, whereof <hi>Armato</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as alſo that the enemies had gotten the iſſue of the Portall, wherewith hee was ſo moued, that in a great rage with very ſmall company he went thether himſelfe, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> &amp; <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo</hi> following after, as if they had been of his company. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their arriuall, <hi>Norandel</hi> had recouered the pallaſadoes of the fortreſſe, and there ſuſtained the whole Turkiſh forces, ſtaying <hi>Gandalins</hi> comming. Now the entry of the court was ſo narow, that more then thrée men could not paſſe through it at once, wherby thoſe of the caſtle had in manner as much aduantage as their enemies. Which <hi>Ambor, Talanque, Gandalin,</hi> and <hi>Libee</hi> made them well féele, comming likewiſe vpon them, for as the king arriued, they thruſt them cleane out of the place, whereby they fled in great haſt, till the Turke himſelfe cauſed them to ſtay, and ſéeing him, they tooke courage, turning their faces,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:58"/> whereby the ſkirmiſh began much whotter then before, <hi>Armato</hi> himſelfe ſhewing great Proweſſe, when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that was ſtil behind him, tooke him by the middle, and in diſpight of them all, carried him vnto the wals of che caſtle, crying with a lowd voice, Bee of good cheare my companions, wee haue taken the king. At the which crie the Turkes ſet ſo fiercely on them, that had it not ben for <hi>Frandalo</hi> (who as yet had not ſhewed himſelfe) they had recouered him againe, but he ioyned himſelfe with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, Norandel,</hi> and the reſt that ſuſtained the force of all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo valiantly, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had meanes to put <hi>Armato</hi> in ſure kéeping, and to returne againe vnto the battaile before it was ended. But it continued not long after, for that newes was preſently carried to the campe, that the king was priſoner with two of his chiefe captaines, taken by <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the king of Denmarke, wherewith they were ſo much abaſhed, that by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little they began to retire, the like did they of the caſtle, contenting themſelues with the booty they had gotten.</p>

And as they were in counſell together, <hi>Gandalin</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:191458:58"/> came vnto them, ſhewing them that king <hi>Armato</hi> deſired for to ſpeake with them, wherevpon they went out of the chamber to heare what hee would ſay. <hi>Frandalo</hi> could ſpeake the Arabian tongue better then the reſt, for that hee had ſerued the king of Turkie, and hee knew him very well, wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to ſpeake for all the reſt. And entring into the chamber, <hi>Frandalo</hi> went firſt, who knéeling on the ground, kiſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings hand. With that <hi>Armato</hi> thinking hee had beene priſoner, aſked him where he was taken. My lord (ſaied he) I am now become a Chriſtian, and a knight of Ieſus Chriſt, that hath done mee ſo much grace, not long time ſince to call mee to bee one of his. A Chriſtian (ſaid the king) is that poſſible? By my ſoule it maketh mee more abaſhed, then the cruell fortune that is now happened vnto mee: for that all knights following armes ought patiently to beare thoſe hazards that they fall into, vſing neceſſitie as a vertue. But thou vnhappy wretch (that through feare and want of courage) haſt forſaken our iuſt and holy law, wherefore takeſt thou not a rope and hangeſt thy ſelfe, as vnworthy to goe vpon the earth? My lord (ſaied hee) you may ſay what pleaſeth you, as being priueledged for the greatneſſe of your eſtate, yet I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I neuer had ſo cowardly a heart as you eſtéeme I haue, but rather account my ſelfe happie to haue done that I haue done. Yet will I not refuſe to doe you ſeruice (my honour ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued) in any thing I can. With that <hi>Armato</hi> remembred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and thought hee did him wrong, wherefore moderating his choler, he ſaied vnto him: Friend <hi>Frandalo,</hi> If it gréeueth mee to haue loſt you, let it not ſéeme ſtrange vnto you, ſéeing now I had greater hope then euer I haue had to bée ſerued by your meanes. But ſéeing it is ſo, you knowe howe I haue vſed you heretofore, now I pray you (if you may doe any thing for mee) to finde the meanes with your companions that I may bee deliuered from hence by ſome reaſonable compoſition. My lord (ſaied <hi>Frandalo,</hi> pointing to <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) This is hee that hath all power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in this place, both ouer you and mee. With that <hi>Armato</hi> looked vpon him, and perceiuing him ſo yoong without a beard, thought <hi>Frandalo</hi> ſaied it to excuſe himſelfe, wherefore hee aſked
<pb facs="tcp:191458:59"/> if he mocked him. God forbid I ſhould doe ſo my lord (ſaied <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo</hi>) but I pray you beléeue me, for it is true, that my lord <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> ſtanding here before you is he and none other that ſlew <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troco, Frerion, Arcalaus</hi> the inchanter, and <hi>Argantes</hi> the Porter of the caſtle, which hee conquered, as you haue been aduertiſed. By my head (ſaied the king) I would hardly haue eſtéemed him for ſo braue a man: but ſéeing it is ſo, I pray thee doe ſomewhat with him touching the thing I told you of euen now. Beléeue mée my lord (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) there ſhall want no good will in me: and with that hee bad him God morrow, and leauing him with his guard, they went into the hall, where they found the tables ready coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for dinner, for it was about noone time. But as <hi>Eſplandian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ill that night, ſo hee made but a meane dinner, not being able to withdraw his mind from thinking on the princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> which was the cauſe that the Tables being vncouered, hee went into his chamber, without any company, onely the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, whom he loued as himſelfe, where being together, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew him the cauſe why he ſent <hi>Carmelle</hi> to Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as alſo what affection hee bare to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine.</hi> And to the end (ſaid he) you bee participant of my ioy, I pray you let vs haue her here, that ſhee may ſhew vs what ſhee learned in her voyage. My lord (ſaied the king of Denmarke) if you ſaw her apparrelled in the gowne the Princeſſe gaue her, I am aſſured you will ſcarſe knowe her at the firſt. Will you that I ſend her word to bring it hether? It is well ſaied (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) with that he called a Squire, ſending him to <hi>Carmelle,</hi> that as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in company of <hi>Arcabonnes</hi> Gentlewomen: but vnderſtanding <hi>Eſplandians</hi> pleaſure, went preſently to apparrell her ſelfe as hee had willed her, and hauing a mantle on her ſhoulders becauſe ſhe would not be ſéene, went to him in his chamber, where ſhe found him and the king of Denmarke talking together: but as ſoon as he eſpied her, he tooke her in his armes, and ſetting her in a chair couered with veluet, ſaied vnto her: My goodfriend, I meane to ſhew my companion you ſée here, how much I loue and eſtéeme him, wherefore I pray you ſhew me before him what intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> gaue you, knowing you came from
<pb facs="tcp:191458:59"/> me, and whether I find any fauour in her ſight. My lord (ſaid ſhe) as ſoone as I was arriued, and that ſhe vnderſtood the cauſe of my comming vnto her, I found her no leſſe yours then you hers: whereby I may eſtéeme you the happieſt knight liuing in the world. And know you why? She is ſo faire, and of ſo comely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, that vnleſſe it bee her ſelfe none can reſemble her, and of truth ſhee dooth farre ſurpaſſe all other ladies, for being alone in her priuate chamber playing on ſome inſtrument, or ſinging for her pleaſure, ſhe ſtealeth and rauiſheth the harts (ſeperated from the bodies of ſuch) as either heare or ſée her: and if at ſometimes ſhe attireth her ſelfe after the Italian manner, with a cap of that country faſhion, then you may ſée her faire and gliſtering haire part giuing a certaine ſhadow on her vermilion chéekes, the reſt knit vp together, inuironing her head, ſhewing with farre better grace then any crowne that ſhe could weare, bée it of ſtones, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or the fineſt gold that may be found. But if that be a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto man, her two humble and modeſt eies (like two ſuns) giue them as many deaths, as they at times behold the ſame, and againe reuiueth them better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Expreſſely ſending you the ſame as an aſſured token of the loue ſhe beareth vnto you, and the good will ſhee will bee ready alwaies to ſhew you during her mortall life. With that ſhee tooke a little boxe out of her boſome wrapped in a péece of Taffata, and gaue it vnto him, which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and taking it out of the boxe, he ſighed tenderly and ſaied: Ha moſt fortunate preſent, (the firſt witneſſe of the perfect alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that the moſt loiall louers that euer liued had together, from whom is deſcended the Paragon of all beauty) happy to haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched ſo néere her perſon: But I much happier that receiueth it, as more affectioned to ſerue her then any other liuing on the earth: and it pleaſeth God, while life indureth, I truſt thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhalt depart from mee, but I will kéepe thée as carefully, as I deſire ſhe ſhould hold my heart. Yet this is not all (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) but behold the recompence of my labour, and ſaying ſo, ſhee caſt the mantle from her ſhoulders, ſhewing them her rich gowne all couered with crownes of gold, which put <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in minde of that <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſent him word by her Gentlewoman, when ſhee ſent him the white armour ſet with the like deuiſe, confirming in his mind the hope that vntill then he had holden doubtfull: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he felt the greateſt eaſe that poſſible he might. And as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the great and excellent workemanſhip, with the great and coſtly imbrodery of Pearles and precious ſtones wherewith it was all couered, <hi>Gandalin</hi> came and knocked at the dore, to ſhew thé that there were a great number of veſſels diſcouered on the ſea, and fearing them to bee ſome new ſupply of Turkes, was of aduiſe they ſhould bee ready to receiue them. Wherevpon each man ranne to armes, cauſing more men to goe into their ſhippes for their better ſafetie: yet that alarme continued but a while, for that the Pennons and Banners of Conſtantinople were perceiued on their ſhips, by ſuch as they ſent out for to deſcry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſome of them comming backe againe in great haſt to ſhew them that <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> as general of the army for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſuccour them: whereof the Turks hauing intelligence, preſently brake vp their campe, being gone farre from the caſtle
<pb facs="tcp:191458:60"/> before any of the veſſels come neare the ſhoare: Neuertheleſſe, thoſe of the caſtle ſet vpon their reare ward, and in the chaſe ſlue ſo great a number, that had not night come on (conſidring the euil order they held) there had not eſcaped a man of all their campe. In the mean time <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> with his army came vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, where <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Denmarke, and diuers others ſtoode ready to receiue him: and after many courteſies and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes on all parts giuen, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> aſked them how they dealt with their enemies. As well as may be (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian,</hi>) but wée could not by any meanes cauſe them to ſtay till your comming, but they are fled from hence as ſoone as they heard newes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Then hee tolde him of the larumes and iſſues by them made during the ſiege, as alſo of the taking of king <hi>Armato.</hi> That is good newes (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles</hi>) God bee praiſed therefore, if mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle the Emperour had beene aduertiſed thereof before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Conſtantinople, I had not found the meanes to come ſend to viſite you, which would haue diſpleaſed mée much, neither would he haue ben at charge to furniſh ſuch a Nauie: but he was in doubt you were in great neceſſity, that at my putting to ſea hée commanded me to make al the ſpéed I could, til he came in perſon with four hundred ſaile y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> already are prepared if our forces ſhould not be ſufficient to ſuſtaine the Turkiſh army: but for this yeare he ſhall be excuſed, if there happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no other aduenture. I pray you (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) come to land, &amp; go with vs into the caſtle, where wee will conferre of all things with ſome better leiſure: Which he agréed vnto, wherewith he &amp; ſome of the principall captaines of his army, entered into the knights boat, and with them went vp into the caſtle: where being arriued, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> that knew king <hi>Armato</hi>) deſired <hi>Eſplandian</hi> before hee did any thing elſe, that hee might ſée him, wherwith hée brought him to the chamber, where he ſate as penſiue as any man could bee, <hi>Gaſtiles</hi> did him honour, as to his eſtate appertained. But king <hi>Armato</hi> would hardly looke vpon him, but ſaied vnto him: <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> I maruaile much why the Emperour your maiſter (contrary to his faith and promiſe) hath broken the peace agréed vpon betwéene vs, and for a thing ſo little importing him as this place doth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb facs="tcp:191458:61"/> hee neuer had any right, as you well knowe. But I perceiue from whence the ſame procéedeth: becauſe hee would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſhould knowe the little faith and leſſe loialty that is in him, which I ſhall one day make him know full well, if euer I eſcape out of this priſon. My lord (ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> your honour ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) the Emperour my maiſter hath in him all the parts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto a wiſe, vertuous, and hardy Prince, ſuch as hee is, and it ſéemeth vnto mee (vnder your correction) that by good and iuſt cauſe he hath done no more then he might do: ſéeing it is euident that this caſtle hath ben conquered by Chriſtian knights, whom he is bound to fauour with all the aid hee can, not onely to defend our law, or becauſe they haue deſired his aide, as being the firſt and greateſt monarch in the world, but to ſuſtaine the right that both hee and his predeceſſors haue alwaies pretended to theſe marches. And where you threaten to make him féele the ſmall loialty whereof you accuſe him, at other times heretofore you haue met each other with your forces, where you ſped ſo hardly, that I rather beléeue you ſpeake in choler then with reaſon, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the eſtate wherein you are at this preſent. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilles</hi> (ſaied <hi>Armato,</hi>) Although I were dead, I haue ſufficient number of Captaines and good Souldiours in my country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge my cauſe, and a ſonne likewiſe, that is not borne to indure the iniury done vnto his father: and thus much I aſſure thée, that if I thought him to bee other, I would ſlay him with mine owne hands as ſoone as I ſhould ſée him.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:61"/> the perſon of an emperor, (a greater lord then you) in whoſe mercy your life or death conſiſteth: for we are all his ſouldiours, ready to doe him ſeruice. The king perceiuing well that hee had done them wrong, and fearing to bee hardlier vſed then hee was accuſtomed to bee, ſaied vnto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> Sir Knight, I pray you pardon my impatience, conſidring with your ſelfe the great gréef and melancholy humour wherein I am, when I (that was wont to be feared and redoubted of al the princes in Aſia) am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to obay the will and pleaſure of my greateſt enemies, which vnto me is ſo extreame gréefe, that I die each day a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, becauſe I cannot die.

My good friends and loial ſubiects, before I begin to ſhew you the cauſe why I haue made you to repaire vnto this place, I wil put you in mind of part of the dangers and great hazards wherein I haue often fallen ſince the death of my brother of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry king <hi>Falangris,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſed God to call me vnto the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this land, and as I thinke there are yet many of you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that can wel remember the danger wherein both I and my country thought to fall, when by the meanes and ſubtletie of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaus</hi> the inchanter, I was deliuered into their hands that long time before had conſpired my death, from whence my ſonne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> deliuered mee: Yet not long after by euill counſell, I made warre againſt him, which ended as all men know, fortune enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of my felicitie, afterward prepared mee ſuch a banket, that without his helpe I had beene priſoner with king <hi>Arauigne,</hi> and vtterly ouerthrowne. And that which hath yet more aſtoniſhed mee was, that when I thought my ſelfe ſure and out of danger of all miſhaps, a worſe then all the former ſuddainely chanced vnto me, the which (conſidering the place wherein I was) I thought verely to haue ben the end and conſumation of my daies. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the Lord God regarding me in pitty, ſent my yong ſonne <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to my ſorrowfull priſon, from whence hée hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee, as no doubt you haue heard. Now my good ſubiects you all ſée mée to bee very old and white haired, hauing already attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the thréeſcore and tenth yeare of mine age, which maketh me think it time now to forget all wordly pleaſures, and to ſerue God to whom I am ſo much bound: And for this cauſe I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from henceforth to forſake all royall dignity, and leaue you my ſon <hi>Amadis</hi> for your king, to whome at this time I yéeld both my Crowne, Scepter, and all the right I haue vnto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of this land: praying you all as much as poſſibly I may, that hereafter you will bee faithfull and true ſubiects vnto him, as you haue alwaies ben to me. And although hée bée but my ſonne in law, if I knew him vnworthy of the place, beléeue mee my good friendes, I would ſooner chuſe a méere ſtranger for my ſucceſſor, then I would doe him: but there is not one among you
<pb facs="tcp:191458:63"/> but knoweth well his great deſerts, and of what race hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: that at this day may well bee called one of the moſt noble and happieſt linages in all the word, as being deſcended from the valiant Troyans, whereof the memory ſhall indure for euer. He is a kings ſonne, heire vnto the crowne of France, &amp; now your Prince and Gouernour, and ſo I leaue him vnto you, with my daughter your Quéene and lawfull Princeſſe: holding to my ſelfe only the caſtle of Mirefleur, where (with Gods helpe) the Quéene and I will end our daies religiouſly, ſeruing God, as we are bound to doe. Then calling <hi>Amadis,</hi> giuing him his royall mantle, he willed him preſently to put it on, the like did the quéen to <hi>Oriane.</hi> Mean time the ſilence was ſo great, that nothing could bée heard among the people but cries and lamentations, mooued with pitty &amp; compaſſion to ſée the determination of their Prince: who being apparrelled in a ſimple robe of blacke cloth, tooke his ſonne and the Quéene his daughter, ſet them in their regal ſeats, and in preſence of all the people, ſet each of them a crown of gold vpon their heads, cauſing them to be proclaimed by the Heralds, King and Quéene of great Brittaigne: That done, euery man departed, ſome wéeping, and others glad, for the aduancement they hoped from the new king, who from thenceforth began ſo wiſely to gouerne his country, that neuer was any prince better beloued nor obaied of his ſubiects. King <hi>Luiſart</hi> within ſhort time after (accompanied of the Quéen and <hi>Grumedan</hi>) went vnto Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refleur as hee had determined to doe, where they liued ſo auſtere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, helping and being preſent at euery houre when ſeruice was to be ſaied as readily as the pooreſt of the old men that remained there, for the adminiſtration and ſeruice to the religious women in the monaſter of the deuout Abbeſſe Adalaſta.

But <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> were no ſooner arriued, but they were diſcouered, yet they fearing a greater ambuſh, the moſt part of them loſing courage, began to flie away: which the two knights perceiuing, entred among them, and at their firſt comming ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw foure or fiue of them vnto the ground, forcing them that were behind to returne againe, wherewith there began a fierce and cruell battaile, for thoſe that firſt began to runne away (loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe and perceiuing only two knights that ſet vpon their fellowes) were ſo aſhamed, that they turned again to help them: neuertheleſſe without the force of thrée Giants that held againſt the knights, they could not haue indured ſo long againſt <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo,</hi> but they thrée fought ſo valiantly with them, that the two knights were in the greateſt danger then euer they were before. And as you ſée a Boare foming at the mouth (follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of a troope of dogs) ſet his taile againſt a trée, and with his
<pb facs="tcp:191458:65"/> tuſkes teare and rent the fleſh of the boldeſt dogs that doe aſſaile him, ſo were <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> among the knights they had aſſailed, ſtriking both on the right hand and the left with ſo great fury, that at one inſtant two of their principall enemies were ſlaine, ſo that there remained but one Giant to fight with them, with whom <hi>Frandalo</hi> made his party good, while <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> followed the reſt, that as then began to flie. But when the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant perceiued <hi>Eſplandian</hi> returne, being in feare of death, he ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped aſide and ſaid vnto <hi>Frandalo,</hi> Sir Knight, you and I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beene companions in many haulty enterpriſes, I pray you therefore ſhew mée the fauour to receiue mee vnto mercy, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you might bée blamed of thoſe that know vs both, for I am your couſin <hi>Foron.</hi> Whereat <hi>Frandalo</hi> was much abaſhed, &amp; could hardly bee perſuaded therevnto, wherefore hee praied him to put off his helmet, and if it be true (ſaid he) that thou art <hi>Foron,</hi> I wil vſe thée both like a friend and kinſman. Wherewith the Giant diſarmed his head, whereby <hi>Frandalo</hi> knewe him and imbraced him, whereat <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was much abaſhed, not knowing what had paſſed betwéene them, with that hee went néerer vnto them, aſking vpon what cauſe that ſalutation procéeded. Then <hi>Franda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> tolde what the Giant was, deſiring him likewiſe to take pittie on him: which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> agréed vnto, then they thrée together went vnto the pauillion, at the entry wherof they found the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman talking with <hi>Carmelle,</hi> no more abaſhed at the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of her men, then if ſhee had ſéene them iuſtle for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.

Wherewith ſhee being abaſhed to ſée him that ſhe eſtéemed wholly to be hers, ſo to haue behaued himſelf againſt her guard, ſaid vnto him: How now <hi>Frandalo,</hi> is this the ſeruice I looked for at your hands, hauing receiued you for my knight? The diuell take ſuch ſeruants, ſéeing you are ſo fainthearted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Madame (ſaid <hi>Frandalo</hi>) ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time I became your knight, at the laſt tourney that I ranne, a lord of greater power hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me into his ſeruice, whom I wil ſerue during my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, ſéeing it hath pleaſed him to ſhew me ſo great fauour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel aſſured, that when you know him as I do, you wil eſtéem me happy, how cowardly or villainous ſoeuer you account mee now. What is he (ſaid ſhe) tel me of your faith? it is Ieſus Chriſt (ſaid <hi>Frandalo:</hi>) yet wil I neuer faile to do you all the honour and ſeruice that I can, as alſo now at this time, ſo my companion bée content, for without him I cannot doe it. <hi>Frandalo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) you may command mee, for I am ready to doe what pleaſeth you: Wherefore delay not to do all the pleaſure &amp; ſeruice you can vnto this lady if it be your will. Wherewith <hi>Frandalo</hi> thanked him moſt hartely, and ſaied to <hi>Heliaxe:</hi> Madame, ſéeing hee will haue it ſo, I pray you from henceforth put all your truſt in mee, and I will not faile to be carefull for you: Mean time I pray you get vpon your palfrey, that I may bring you to a place where you may ſée farre better tourneyes then any at your wedding: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward (if it pleaſeth God to fauour vs) you ſhall eaſily perceiue how much I eſtéeme and haue in remembrance the fauours you haue heretofore ſhewed vnto mee, being but a ſimple knight, and you a great Princes to command farre better then my ſelfe: for neuer was Princeſſe more honoured and eſtéemed among her owne ſubiects then you ſhall bee of them, to whome I meane to bring you, which may bee an example vnto kings and mightie Princes, to whome God hath giuen power and authoritie, who being aduertiſed of the honourable and good intertainment made to you by vs, they may be moued hereafter to take pleaſure in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the meaner as wel as the greater, conſidring the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie of fortune, as by your ſelfe it well appeareth. <hi>Frandalo</hi> (ſaied ſhe) you may make as many excuſes and faire promiſes as you liſt, yet can you not deny but you haue done mee wrong, yet
<pb facs="tcp:191458:66"/> in doing as you ſaie you will, your reputation will bee better to the world, although your faith hath failed to our gods: wherefore let vs goe where it pleaſeth you. With that ſhe got vpon her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, and <hi>Frandalo</hi> bareheaded leading her horſe, till they came néere vnto the towne, where they heard a great noiſe, that made the two knights thinke, either their enterpriſe to be diſcouered, or that their Souldiours aſſailed the Towne. And fearing they had ben repulſed, began to repent themſelues of their long ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Princeſſe, to whom <hi>Frandalo</hi> in moſt courteous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaied: Madame, Is it not your pleaſure (meane time that I and my companion goe vnto the towne) to ſtay here for vs with this Gentlewoman and my couſin <hi>Foron?</hi> I truly (ſaid <hi>Heliaxa</hi>) and I will not depart from hence before I heare of you againe. With that <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ranne in great haſt towards the Towne, where they found their companions fighting with thoſe of Alfarin, among the which were <hi>Talanque, Ambor,</hi> the king of Denmarke, <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Lazinde,</hi> that had giuen the town a hard ſkirmiſh on that ſide, thinking to giue them ſo much to doe, that in the meane time the army by ſea might aſſaile the water gate: but they were too ſoone diſcouered, whereby they found great reſiſtance on all ſides: Neuertheleſſe <hi>Norandel</hi> and <hi>Belleris</hi> had gotten the Barriers, and repulſed the enemies vnto the palliſadoes. Which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> perceiuing, they lighted on foot, and being couered with their ſhields, their ſwords in their hands, paſſed through the preaſe, and with bold courage, went ſo farre, that they ſlewe great number of the enemies: for the Alfarins to defend their citty iſſued out of the gates, and the Chriſtians to winne it, did moſt valiantly, but the place was ſo narrow, they could not hurt their enemies ſo much as in the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> field. Whereby it happened, that <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either to winne or looſe, ſtepped ſo farre forward, that the Alfarins flying into the towne, and they after, found themſelues alone within the ſame among their enemies, and that ſo farre, that had it not ben for <hi>Frandalo, Eſplandian</hi> (that tooke no care but only to kill and ouerthrow the enemy) had ben incloſed by them, but hee pulled him backe. Whereby the two knights perceaued
<pb facs="tcp:191458:66"/> the danger they were in, wherefore by little and little they got vnto the ſteps, that went vpon the wall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where they ſuſtained many hard aſſalts without being hurt, although the enemy cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to throw Launces, Stones, Darts, and all other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons at them they could find, none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daring come to handle ſtrokes, for if any aduanced himſelfe to ſhew his Prowes, it coſt him his life, or els was throwne downe headlong. Meane time <hi>Norandel</hi> and his company, that had ſéene <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſhut into the towne, ſought by all meanes to ſcale the wals, or elſe to breake the gates: but all in vaine, for they within defended it ſo well with Oile, ſcalding Water, Logs and Stones, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them were ouerthrowne, and ended their liues moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably. And fighting in that ſort, a knight all armed came from the Hauen, crying with a loud voice and ſaid: Be of good courage my children, be of good courage, defend this quarter well, for our enemies on the ſea ſide haue not as yet found meanes to ſet one man on land, and yet haue loſt aboue two hundred of their men. By God (ſaied one of them) I ſée not one that ſtandeth idle, yet can we not ouercome theſe two knights. Why ſo (ſaid the other?) They are (ſaied he) entered in among vs, and wee haue ben theſe two howers fighting with them, but all in vaine, for the yoongeſt of them fighteth ſo valiantly, that wee dare not approch them: And which is more, hee and his companion in deſpight of vs all haue gotten thoſe ſtaires, where they now defend themſelues, and that ſo well that we can find no means to driue them thence, although many of our men haue been ſlain by them, &amp; others cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly wounded. I am of opinion (ſaid the knight) that wee receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto mercy, for it may bee they are ſuch men, that for to haue them againe, the enemy will bée glad to giue king <hi>Armato</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and returne againe into their country. Wherevnto they all agéed, and therewith the knight that had giuen them that counſell, made ſignes vnto <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that they would parley with them, whereby the aſſault ceaſed for a time, and the knight ſpake vnto them in this manner, Sir knights, you ſée it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to eſcape from hence, and it were great pitty that two ſo valiant knights ſhould die ſo yoong now in the flower of
<pb facs="tcp:191458:67"/> your ages. But this wee will doe, yéeld your ſelues, and wee will ſaue your liues. Sir knight (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) If wee die at this time, we are quit for euer after, but ſo much there wanteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and wee haue ſo good hearts and ſo ſure a confidence in Ieſus Chriſt, in whoſe quarrell we fight, that wee hope he will giue vs meanes not only to eſcape this danger, but to ſpoile the Towne and lead you priſoners with vs: Wherefore take this counſell for your ſelues, and yéelde you vnto vs before the wrath of God bée further moued againſt you. When they that ſtood about them heard thoſe wordes, both great and ſmall began to crie with a lowd voice, ſaying: Stay that villaine, let him die, or wee will die here at his féet: wherewith they aſſailed them ſo fiercely, that they were conſtrained to get vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higheſt ſteps. But not long after they repulſed the enemy ſo valiantly with ſtones (whereof they found great quantity vpon the Portall) that from that time forwards they had no longer ſtomacks to aſſaile them. But <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randel</hi> and the reſt being without, vnderſtanding the noiſe and the voice of their companions, whome they eſtéemed dead or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, determined to ſet fire on the gates, while the reſt aſſailed the towne: Wherewith euery man ranne to fetch wood, which the Alfarins perceiued, but to conclude, they could not ſhun it, but whether they would or not, the draw-bridge and the gates were ſet on fire: wherewith they were ſo abaſhed, that moſt part of them began to flie vnto the great temple of Iupiter, the principall place of ſtrength within their citty, the reſt ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind, with full determination rather to die then ſuffer the Chriſtians to enter the Towne. And ſéeing the gates burnt downe, ſo many of them ranne to fetch water, that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chriſtians had meanes to aſſaile the towne on that ſide, which aſſault continued ſo long that day failed, yet could they not enter by reaſon of the great reſiſtance the Alfarins made, but the two knights that were aboue did them ſo much hurt with blockes and ſtones, that not any of them durſt appeare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Chriſtians became maiſters of the towne. Wherin great number of people, both men, women, and children, were put to the ſword, and more had died had it not ben night, ſpecially on the

And for the ſame cauſe he ſent to the army on land that they ſhould do the like: wherewith euery man retired, ſetting watch in thoſe places where moſt néed required. The towne in this ſort being conquered, and the people gotten into the great temple of Iupiter, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> minding not to loſe the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> nor the Giant <hi>Foron,</hi> that he and <hi>Frandalo</hi> left with <hi>Carmelle,</hi> deſired <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Lazinde</hi> to goe fetch them, and with them hee ſent <hi>Sergil</hi> his Squire to bring them to the place: which they preſently did, and made ſuch haſt, that they found her ſitting by a great fire that <hi>Foron</hi> had made, where ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their horſes &amp; ſaluting <hi>Heliaxe, Gandalin</hi> ſaid: Madame, my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> praieth you to come vnto the place where hee ſtaieth for you. My friends (ſaied ſhee) I knew him not, true it is I was brought hether by two knights, whereof one is <hi>Frandalo,</hi> that I haue knowne long time, but for the other I aſſure you as farre as I remember I neuer ſawe him before. Madame (ſaied <hi>Carmelle</hi>) hee is ſonne to the valiant knight <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> whoſe fame is ſpread ſo farre about the world. Truly (ſaied <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axa</hi>) I haue heard of him, ſo haue you (as I thinke ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) of my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> his ſonne: for hee alone conquered the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> and now lately hath taken king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> your father in lawe, and I can aſſure you hee is one of the courteous knights liuing in the world. I am much abaſhed then (ſaied ſhe) how he ſhewed himſelfe ſo vncourteous in my behalf, not ſpeaking vnto me while I was in his company, yet me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth being his priſoner, hee could haue done no leſſe then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mée, either with good ſpéeches or faire promiſes, whereof hee hath vſed ſo few, that while I liue I ſhall neuer thinke well of him. Madame (ſaied <hi>Carmelle</hi>) you take the matter otherwiſe then it is, for if hee refrained to ſpeake vnto you, it was by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great acquaintance hee perceiued <hi>Frandalo</hi> to haue with you, vnto whome he is ſo great a friend, that hee was not
<pb facs="tcp:191458:68"/> onely content to giue him leaue to entertaine you, but much greater fauour would hee doe vnto him if hee can. You may ſay what you will (ſaied ſhee:) Neuertheleſſe, if he haue no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe then that you alledge in his behalfe, hee ſhall neuer loſe the diſliking hee hath gotten at my hands.

Madame (ſaied <hi>Lazinde</hi>) It is not yet thrée howers ſince the Towne was taken by aſſault. Good God (ſaied ſhe) what miſerable fortune was that for the poore inhabitants, I thinke they are all put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſword. No madame (ſaied <hi>Lazinde</hi>) the greater part haue ſaued themſelues in the great Temple of Iupiter, but they will hardly eſcape when it is day, for our Generals are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to burne the Temple. If it bee ſo (ſaied ſhee) that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo</hi> hath any credite with his companions, and that hee that ſent you bee ſo courteous as this Gentlewoman reporteth him to bee, I hope they will take pittie on the poore people: at leaſt, if not for the loue of them, I truſt vpon requeſt for my ſake they will not refuſe it. And to the end I come not thether for late, I pray you when day appeareth, let vs preſentlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, wherewith laying her downe vpon a cloke, ſhee paſſed the reſt of the night, not greatly to her eaſe.</p>

With that they all mounted on their horſes, and made ſuch haſt, that they entred into the town, as the Chriſtians began to aſſault the fortreſſe, and when <hi>Frandalo</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> hee rode vnto her, bidding her God morrow, and taking her palfry by the bridle bareheaded, brought her to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company that did her great honor, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing her to be a kings doughter, and wife to ſo great a Prince. With that ſhee aſked <hi>Frandalo</hi> which of them was <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> Madame (ſaied hee, pointing vnto him) here he is ready to do you any ſeruice that he can, as hee hath aſſured mee. But when ſhee perceiued him to bee ſo yoong and of ſo great beautie, ſhee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed to think how nature had furniſhed him with ſo many good perfections, eſpecially of ſo great and incomparable force, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had the commendation among the moſt valerous knights: wherewith ſhee ſaied vnto <hi>Frandalo,</hi> In good faith I haue heard him commended in diuers places for one of the beſt knights li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the world, and of mine owne knowledge I haue ſéen him doe that which I would neuer haue thought to bee in him, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his yoong yeares, ſo that if hee abound as much in courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as he doth in valour and beautie, I thinke him to bee the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt Gentleman that may bee found: which I ſhall preſently ſée if he graunt me one requeſt. Madame (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> bluſhing at the praiſes ſhe vſed in reſpect of him) If I doe it not, you ſhall be the firſt that euer I refuſed gift vnto in all my life: and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering your great beautie and moſt courteous behauiour, howe ſhould it be poſſible for me to diſobay your will? I pray you then ſir knight (ſaid ſhe) to pardon the poore people that are within the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:69"/> Temple, and graunt them vnto mee, with leaue to ſend them where I ſhall thinke good, not hurting them any more. In good truth madame (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you ſhall not be refuſed for ſo ſmal a matter, and I will doe ſo much with the other knights, that they ſhall giue conſent, as alſo to your owne libertie and the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Forons,</hi> to guide you where it pleaſeth you, which <hi>Frandalo</hi> did moſt earneſtly deſire at our handes before you arriued here: And for his ſake looke what elſe you will command at our hands, wee are ready to performe it with all our hearts. For the which the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe</hi> thanked him moſt heartely, and turning to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> ſaied vnto him: Sir Knight, the good that you and your companions doe vnto mee, ſhall neuer bee forgotten on my part, but I will by all means ſéeke to acknowledge the ſame, although preſently I cannot doe it: wherefore if it pleaſeth you, cauſe your ſouldiours to retire, that theſe poore diſtreſſed people may come forth according to your promiſe: In the meane time I will goe comfort them, for I am in doubt moſt part of them are rather dead then liuing: with that ſhe deſired <hi>Carmelle</hi> to bear her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they two going to the Temple gate, which they found faſt ſhut and rampired vp: then ſhée called ſo lowd, that ſome of them ſpake vnto her: but neuer did men by pardon from their Prince, brought backe againe from the Gibbet, more reioice, nor were better comforted then they when they knew her, thinking the prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> had made ſome agréement with their enemies. Wherefore they opened a little wicket, whereat ſhee and the Gentlewoman entered into the Temple, they aſking the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe howe it was her chaunce to come thether in ſo good a time to ſuccour them, that looked for no other fauour then moſt cruell death. My friends (ſaied ſhe) I haue done ſo much with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (by <hi>Frandalos</hi> meanes) whome I haue knowne long time, that they are content to let you iſſue foorth, your liues ſaued, and goe where it pleaſeth you, and my ſelfe likewiſe that had fallen into their hands as well as you: wherefore chuſe whether you will follow mee to Teſifant where my lord <hi>Alphorax</hi> is, who for my ſake will ſhew you all the fauor and courteſie he may. When the poore people vnderſtood the agréement made for them by the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:69"/> Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> they all agréed to goe with her, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her, giuing her moſt hearty thankes for the good ſhee had wrought them. Then (ſaied <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) let thoſe that haue armour put it off, and come all forth with mee. Then ſhe being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in that manner, came vnto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and ſhewing him great numbers of women and little children that ſtood about her, ſaid vnto him: I pray you ſir knight behold the good whereof you are the cauſe, and thinke what domage it had beene if theſe poore ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lly ſoules had ſuffered death for no offence, wherein you are worthy great commendations. And yet (ſaid ſhée, ſmiling) while I liue, I ſhall not forget the ſmall account you made of me when <hi>Frandalo</hi> and you found mee before my pauillion, after the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of my knights. Wherefore madame (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian?</hi>) I maruaile (ſaied ſhée) why you aſke mee ſuch a queſtion, ſéeing you might well conceiue what gréefe I had in mind, yet did you not ſo much as once ſalute me, or vſe word vnto mee: in good truth it was but diſcourteouſly done of you. Madame (ſaied hee) I beſéech you pardon mee, for the fault I committed in your behalfe, was not done for want of bringing vp, but fearing to bréede ſome iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in <hi>Frandalos</hi> mind, ſéeing him ſo much affected to doe you ſeruice, together with the good countenaunce you ſhewed vnto him, although you had loſt your men. This excuſe (ſaid <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) is not to be accepted, neither ſhal you eſcape ſo eaſily therewith: which ſhee ſpake with ſo good a countenance, that her ſéeming to bee offended, contented all the company: wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſaied vnto her, Madame, I am content to make amends for this great fault, or to doe what pennance it pleaſeth you. The pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (ſaid ſhe) that you ſhall haue ſhall be, that according to the promiſe of mercy you haue made vnto theſe poore people, as alſo of fauour in mine owne behalfe, you giue vs leaue to go vnto the citty of Teſifant to my huſband, that for the ſame we thinke the better of you. Madame (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) you haue already vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our minds, wherefore you may fréely go whether it pleaſeth you, and I my ſelf will be your guide if it be your pleaſure. With that <hi>Heliaxe</hi> gaue them many thankes, and taking her leaue, got vpon her palfrey, and being accompanied of <hi>Foron</hi> with a
<pb facs="tcp:191458:70"/> great number of the poore people, tooke the way that went to Teſifant, <hi>Frandalo</hi> going with her aboue a league and more, and further would haue gone although hee were wounded in diuers places of his body, but ſhe deſired him to go back againe. For (ſaid ſhe) although like a good &amp; curteous knight you haue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means not onely to ſerue mee, but alſo to ſaue the life of me and mine, it may bee I ſhall not haue ſo the like to doe the ſame for you if you fall into my lord <hi>Alphorax</hi> hands: who as I thinke ere now is aduertiſed of my miſfortune, whereby I am in doubt hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the field with great number of men to ſuccour me. And if it ſhould be ſo, I know him ſo impatient, that if hee méet with you (being already moued with the loſſe of Alfarin, as alſo the iniury my knights haue receiued, and my ſelfe likewiſe as hee will ſuppoſe) the pleaſure that you doe me would bréed a danger to your perſon, and to me great gréefe, wherefore I pray you goe no further, but turne backe againe. <hi>Frandalo</hi> knew her counſell to be good, wherewith hee committed her to God: leauing her in the guard of his couſin <hi>Foron,</hi> and therewith returned the ſame way that hee came. It was then ſomewhat late, wherfore <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe</hi> hauing trauailed vnto the aduenturous fountain, and finding her pauillion as yet ſtanding vp, determined not to depart from thence till the next day in the morning, that ſhee tooke the way that led to Teſifant. And hauing ridden till noone, ſhee met the Prince <hi>Alphorax,</hi> with a great number of knights that all night had ſtaied vpon the way to the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe that had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wife would lead her thether, to haue her in ſafe kéeping, and ſuch was their opinion that brought him newes thereof. But they met not any man in the way, wherfore they returned againe to go vnto the aduenturous fountain, much gréeued when they perceiued the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe</hi> comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to whom <hi>Alphorax</hi> ranne, and imbraſing him with a louing kiſſe, aſked her how ſhe had eſcaped from the enemy. My lord (ſaid ſhe) when I ſhall haue told you how, yet am I in doubt you will hardly beléeue it. And to ſay the truth, it ſéemeth fortune hath taken pleaſure in one day to make mee know both the good and euill ſhee could doe vnto mee. Then ſhee ſhewed him of the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:70"/> ouerthrow of her knights, the words that paſſed betwéene <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo, Eſplandian,</hi> and her: and laſtly the honeſt intertainement they vſed in her behalfe. Truly madame (ſaied <hi>Alphorax</hi>) it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange, and I cannot imagine how theſe Chriſtian dogs (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken my Towne of Alfarin by aſſault) haue vſed ſo much humanity, not only to theſe people, but haue ſaued your honour, being ſuch and ſo beautifull a lady as you are. But it is to bee thought, that our gods hauing compaſſion on me, haue preſerued you, as the thing I loue and moſt eſtéeme off in this world. Yet if I liue but one yeare longer, I ſweare and promiſe vnto you to aſſemble ſo many men together, that the citty of Conſtantinople and her periured Emperour ſhal ſuffer and indure much woe: in ſuch manner, that the memory thereof ſhal not be extinct for one thouſand yeares after my deceaſe. <hi>Heliaxe</hi> that perceiued him enter into choler, to pacefie the ſame, anſwered vim and ſaid: My lord, you may doe it when it pleaſeth you, but at this preſent you ſée here a great number of poore deſolate people, I beſéech you ſpeake vnto them and comfort them as wel as you may, for their whole truſt is in you, with that <hi>Alphorax</hi> going vnto them, gaue them many gracious and comfortable ſpéeches, and with them returned to the citty of Teſifant.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:191458:71"/> to aduertiſe him what I had done, to the end he might determine either to come himſelfe in perſon, if occaſion ſerued, with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hee is already preparing, or elſe wholly to breake off his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, for it now beginneth to bee Winter, and ſéeing (as it is Gods will) that your affaires on this ſide are in good eſtate, I am determined as to morrow to depart hence to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, that the Emperour vnderſtanding by mee what hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on this ſide the ſea, he ſhall not bee forced for this yeare to bee at further charges, wherof before this time I had willingly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefieed him, had it not ben the daily expectation I had to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of this our laſt enterpriſe, which God bee thanked is fallen out as we deſired. My lord (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) ſéeing the Emperour (as you ſay) by your returne may receiue both, pleaſure and profite, you ſhall doe well to make haſt thether: one thing I beſéech you doe for me, that is, moſt humbly to commend me vnto his grace, aſſuring him, that not any ſubiect hee hath, is or ſhall bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to obey him then my ſelfe: and as touching our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, for that you haue perſonally both ſéene and béene an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the ſame, you can aduertiſe him at large.

My lord (ſaied he) at our departure from hence wee had ſo good a winde, that without any let wee arriued at the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> yet could wee not make ſuch haſt, but that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with his great Serpent, and <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſhips had already drowned and ouerthrowne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the enemies ſhips, and made the reſt to flie, and the next day after king <hi>Armato</hi> was taken priſoner, his army ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and put to flight: but the ſport was when I ſaluted the Turke, and that hee knew mee, then hee told the great rage the Turke was in, the threatnings and ſpéeches hee vſed vnto him, the ouerthrow of the twenty knights at the aduenturous foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the ſkirmiſhes and aſſaults at the Towne of Alfarin, the danger wherein <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Frandalo</hi> found themſelues, the taking of the Towne and of <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> her deliuery with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that fled to the temple of Iupiter, and how that before hee imbarked himſelfe to returne, a great ſhippe arriued there from great Brittaigne with diuers knights therin, whoſe names and ſirnames he rehearſed, as hauing ſéene them with king <hi>Amadis.</hi> Further my lord (ſaid he) the good knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> willed me to ſhewe you that hee kéepeth king <hi>Armato</hi> till your grace ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of him, as alſo the citty of Alfarin, but for the caſtle <hi>La mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne defendu,</hi> hee ſaith hee mindeth not to yéeld the ſame to any other then to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> in whoſe name hee hath conquered it, hoping as her ſeruaunt and no other to defend the ſame. When will he be here (ſaied the Emperour?) With all the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:73"/> ſpéed hee may (ſaied <hi>Gaſtilles</hi>) as hee hath promiſed mee. In good faith (ſaied the Emperour) I would it were this day before to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, I haue ſo great deſire to knowe him by reaſon of the great chiualry that daily increaſeth in him, in ſuch manner, that if heretofore the knight with the Gréene Sword hath béen eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beſt in all the world, now his ſonne diminiſheth a great part of his glory. And all being well conſidered, I thinke that <hi>Amadis</hi> hath not done more in tenne yeares time, then <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> hath accompliſhed in the ſpace of tenne wéekes: But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Frandalo,</hi> is hee ſo well diſpoſed to our ſeruice as you make report? My lord (ſaied <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi>) It is not poſſible to doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he hath done: wherefore, my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> willed mee to ſhew you, that for the better entertaining him in his procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, hée is of aduiſe that your grace ſhould giue him the citty of Alfarin, not knowing any man worthier then hee to kéepe it. In good truth (ſaied the Emperour) <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his companions haue had the paines to conquer it, wherefore I am content they haue the diſpoſing thereof: Neuertheleſſe, if they reſt vpon my conſent therein, I am well content it ſhall bee ſo, and I will not ceaſe to ſhewe him greater fauour, if hee perſeuer as hee hath begun. And you daughter (ſaied hee to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi>) what ſay you to this that my couſin <hi>Gaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

My lord (ſaied ſhe) I know not how you and many others eſtéeme ſo much of him, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſmall obedience hee ſheweth to his father, for if he were ſuch a knight as hee is reported, hee had long ſince come hether to acquite the promiſe wherevnto hee is bound: which maketh mee verily thinke, the ſpéech <hi>Carmelle</hi> vſed of him, and all that hee hath ſent you by word of mouth by my couſin <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> are onely but diſſimulations. And I for my part am not yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (although hee reporteth himſelfe to bee my knight) to accept him for the ſame, much leſſe to pardon him before hee comes in perſon to excuſe his fault, then I will conſider what I haue to doe. The emperor that perceaued his doughter ſpeak with ſuch a choler, &amp; therwith to bluſh more then ordinary, could not refrain
<pb facs="tcp:191458:73"/> laughter, and ſaied vnto her. What daughter, doe you refuſe the ſeruice of the beſt knight in all the world? I my lord (ſaied ſhee) and ſo ſhould euery maiſter his ſeruant, when hee flieth from his preſence, and obeyeth not his commandements no more then he hath done both yours and mine. Truly ſwéet heart (ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) I like you well, I would to God that nature had furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed you with a bodie like vnto your heart, if ſhee had, ſhee had made you a perfect man, and not a woman as you are. Nowe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe you heare my doughters anſwere, I pray you let <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> know it, that he may make haſt hether, leaſt he loſe not her good will. And although the Emperour ſpake it as in ieſt, <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> tooke it otherwiſe when he heard the newes by a ſquire that <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> ſent vnto him.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He knights of great Brittaigne arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Towne of Alfarin, (as you heard before) <hi>Frandalo</hi> and others that were hurt being healed of their wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, <hi>Belleris</hi> that ceaſed not continually to hearken after <hi>Alphorax,</hi> was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his ſpies, that hee continued in the citty of Teſifannt, which hee and <hi>Branfil</hi> told vnto the reſt of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who therewith being ſomewhat incouraged, very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired <hi>Frandalo</hi> to lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth, and bring them to ſome place where they might lie in ambuſh to ſurpriſe <hi>Alphorax</hi> or ſome of his companie if they chaunced to ſtray abroad. <hi>Frandalo</hi> not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny them any reaſonable requeſt, agréed (with the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:74"/> conſent of <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) to depart the next night following, and to take with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the number of foureſcore knights and no more, which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> liked well, he minding to bee one. Where vpon thoſe that were appointed for the iourney prepared themſelues, and about ſunne ſetting iſſued out of Alfarin, <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country ſo well, that they néeded no other guides, but trauailed ſtrait towards Teſifant, and hauing ridden till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the clocke at night, they came vnto a croſſe way, where <hi>Frandalo</hi> aduiſed them to deuide themſelues in two companies, willing the knights (that before that time had neuer ben in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie) to hold cloſe together. For (ſaid he) the warres in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are far otherwiſe then they are in great Brittaigne, where knights vſe moſt commonly to trauaile alone without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and although they chaunce ſometimes to ride in companies, the leaſt occaſion that happeneth maketh them ſeperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but here thoſe that vſe armes trauaile in great companies together, whereby the combates that are fought here moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are rather battailes then incounters. And more then this, if thrée hundred Turkes chance to ſurpriſe one hundred, thirtie, twenty, or leſſe number of their enemies, they take a pride to put them to death, preferring reuenge before a certaine kind of honour, that (as I haue vnderſtoode) is kept and obſerued in the Weſt parts, where combates are in a manner equall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my friends (ſaied he) I pray you ſeperate not your ſelues, but march all in a company, aſſuring you that in the place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee goe, wee ſhall not faile to finde men ſufficient againſt whome wee may imploy our forces, and ſhewe what valour is in vs. I knowe that within halfe a mile of Teſifant <hi>Alpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> vſeth oftentimes to lie at a houſe that hee hath cauſed to bee made called Gruobinach, where if it bee our good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes wee may chaunce to finde him, wherefore I am of aduiſe that we deuide our ſelues in two companies, my nephew <hi>Belleris</hi> ſhall take the left hand, and lie in ambuſh néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the village of Ientinomele, from whence hee may eaſily perceaue when any man iſſueth out of Teſifant, and I with <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the other halfe of our companie will followe
<pb facs="tcp:191458:74"/> this way that bringeth vs vnto a valley néere to Gruobinach, where we will ſecretly ſtay if néed require, to ſuccour each other: whereunto they all agréed: but before they departed thence, they found their enterpriſe to be far more dangerous than they eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, as hereafter you ſhall heare. <hi>Belleris</hi> and his companie leauing <hi>Frandalo,</hi> trauailed ſo long, that about two houres before day they met fixe ſouldiours, whome <hi>Belleris</hi> ſaluted in the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian language, aſking them of what place they were. My Lord, ſaid they, we are going to the towne of Sraſſe. My good friends (ſaid he) we trauaile this night to Teſifante to aduertiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> of the great dommage and deſtruction the Chriſtian dogges continually doe and within ſhort ſpade haue done vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey round about: for they are iſſued out of Alfarin, &amp; haue taken and carried away all they can find: and as yet are abroad, not ceaſing to execute all tyrannie they can deuiſe: neuertheles, if it pleaſeth him to giue vs aid, wée know the place of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, where we may eaſily incloſe them, &amp; not one of them ſhall eſcape. What are you, ſaid the ſouldiours, that bring vs theſe newes? Friends (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) I am <hi>Rouſſan,</hi> couſin to <hi>Eiraca,</hi> ehiefe captaine of Teſifant. We can tell you good newes of him, ſaid the ſouldiours, wherewith we thinke you will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for he is not farre from hence, being ridden out of Teſifant with two hundred knights to goe vnto Falandie, to ſée the ſame be not ſo lightly ſurpriſed as Alfarin was. But becauſe he willed vs to ride before, wée will ſtay no longer: wherewith they hadde them farewell. Friends (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) the good fortune I wiſh you I pray God may happen vnto you. With that the ſouldiours paſſed on their way, but they had not gone farre when <hi>Belleris</hi> ſent after them, and fearing they would diſcouer his enterpriſe, cauſed them to be ſlaine: and therewith preſently diſpatched one of his Squires on meſſage to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> to aduertiſe him of the enemies béeing abroad with a verie ſtrong and huge companie: whereupon hée wiſhed him to ioyne with them. The Squire made all the haſt hée could, but before the newes came to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo, Belleris</hi> met with <hi>Eiraca</hi> and his company about the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Ientinomele, béeing vpon them before they had time to
<pb facs="tcp:191458:75"/> put on their helmets. There did the captaine of Teſifant ſhewe himſelfe to be no yoong beginner in armes, for that like a valiant and hardy knight hee entered among the Chriſtians, and being ſeconded by his men, did moſt valiantly defend themſelues, and aſſailed the enemy, although at their firſt encounter ten of their braueſt ſouldiours were vnhorſed and ouerthrowne. And as <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raca</hi> entered into the preaſe, <hi>Norandel</hi> and he met together with ſuch force, that <hi>Norandel</hi> was wounded in the left ſhoulder, but not ſore hurt, and the captaine of Teſifant looſing his ſtirrops, was throwne ouer his horſe with ſo great a ſtrength, that with the fall hee was forced to lie vpon the ground, and could remooue neither hand nor foote, which the Turkes perceauing, to reléeue their captaine, did ſo valiantly, that they ouerthrew foure of the Brittiſh knights, who neuertheleſſe roſe preſently againe, and with their ſwords in hand, thruſt ſo many of the Turkes horſes into the ſides and flanckes, that in ſhort ſpace more then twentie of the Turkes were ouerthrowne likewiſe, and many ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: at that charge <hi>Enil</hi> and <hi>Gauarte</hi> were hurt, and the reſt ſo hardly handeled, that without <hi>Frandalos</hi> company that came to ſuccour them, they had all beene ourthrowne: and in truth they had almoſt ſtraied too long, but the Squire that <hi>Belleris</hi> ſent vnto them, could not ouertake them before they were in the valey where they ſhould haue met. And although they had heard the ſound of their blowes, yet did they not ſuſpect any ſuch perrill, vntill the ſquire had done his meſſage, wherewith they ranne with all the ſpéed they could vnto the place, where <hi>Belleris</hi> and his companions (being out of breath) did nothing but recule, and defend themſelues againſt their enemies blowes, that had ſlaine diuers of them, but that the captain of Teſifant would haue them to bee taken and preſented to the Prince <hi>Alphorax:</hi> Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Frandalo, Eſplandian,</hi> and the reſt of their company, made them change opinion: for when they perceaued their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo hardly matched by the enemy, they entered among them with ſuch fury, that had it not beene for <hi>Eiraca</hi> (who at that time behaued himſelfe moſt valiantly) they had ouerthrown y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turks at their firſt onſet, but by reaſon of the great reſiſtance hee
<pb facs="tcp:191458:75"/> made, they continued fighting halfe an houre after, wherein hée maintained himſelfe ſo well, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> could neuer take him before hée had ouerthrowne him, and pulled off his helmet, wherewith hée yéelded: meane time <hi>Frandalo</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being in the middle of the enemies, laide ſo well about them, ſlaying horſes, pulling away ſhields, and doing ſo valiantly, that woonder it was to behold them, yet did not the Turkes once ſéeme abaſhed, but ſtill fought moſt couragiouſly, vntil ſuch time they perceiued their captaine taken priſoner, which cauſed them to flie and turne their backes: but not all of them, for there lay more than one hundred and fiftie of them dead vpon the ground, the reſt ſaued themſelues by meanes of the darke night. It was then about an houre before day: and <hi>Frandalo</hi> fearing that thoſe of Teſifant (hearing of the ouerthrow) would iſſue foorth to cut off their paſſage, preſently cauſed captaine <hi>Eiraca</hi> to be remoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the Chriſtians that wanted horſes, and with all ſpéed rode backe againe to Alfarin, not the ſame way they came, but another way ſomewhat farther about; wherein they trauailed ſo long, that about ſunne riſing they entred into a great woode, where they alighted to refreſh both themſelues and their horſes: and ſtaying not long there leaſt they ſhould bée ſurpriſed, they made ſuch ſpéed, that about ſunne ſetting they arriued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town: meane time newes came to Teſifant of the ouerthrowe of their men, wherewith <hi>Alphorax</hi> was in ſuch a rage, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hée ſéemed deſperate. But for this time wée haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſed of martiall affaires, now wée meane to bring Loue in place, who deſiring to miniſter ſome comfort to the Princes <hi>Leonorine</hi> that liued in great paine, expecting the arriuall of her friend <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> cauſed him to depart from Alfarin to viſit her in the citie of Conſtantinople, as in the Chapters following you ſhall heare.</p>

The Squire did as ſhe willed him, and followed her to <hi>Eſplandians</hi> lodging: where entring into his chamber, ſhe found him ſitting vpon his bed tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the king of Denmarke, and deliuered him <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> letter, which when he read, the teares ranne out of his eyes, and therewith caſt forth a great ſigh, ſaying: O Lord? but <hi>Carmelle</hi> that beheld him, doubting the cauſe to be as ſhe ſuſpected, aſked him if he were ill at eaſe.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:76"/> my Lord? are you abaſhed at ſo ſmall a matter? By my ſoule I now perceiue very well, that the affections and loues of men are farre different and much vnlike the paſſions that we ſimple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men endure, when we fall into the like extremities: and knowe you how? you men doe moſt commonly take pleaſure to manifeſt and make known your loue either by word of mouth or outward ſhewes, and many times diſſemble more than you meane to doe: and which is worſe, how much the more the Lady or Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man you loue is of great deſert, or high linage, ſo much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doe you take to make it knowne, not onely that you beare her affection, but that you are beloued and fauoured of her aboue all others: which is cleane contrary to the nature of women (I meane ſuch as may bée tearmed wiſe and of good vnderſtanding) for how much the greater their parentage is, ſo much more feare they haue to manifeſt their amorous paſſions, in ſuch manner, that moſt commonly both in word, geſture, and countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they outwardly denie that which they haue moſt déepely engraued in their hearts and mindes: and not without good cauſe, for that the thing which redoundeth to your praiſe and commendations (as you think, which is the manifeſting of your loue) bréedeth to them a certaine ſpot in their honour, which often times they can not eaſily deface. Wherefore it is more than expedient, to obſerue this modeſtie and conſtancie in vs, not that I meane to reſtraine my ſelfe vnto this lawe, ſéeing that all my glory and felicitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon you, in ſuch manner, that I deſire no greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in this world, then that the loue and dutifull obedience I beare vnto you, ſhould be publiſhed and made knowne vnto the world, to the end that all thoſe that ſhall heare of your great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and my meane eſtate, may know my great good fortune, to haue the meanes to ſerue you as I doe. Wherefore my Lord, in my opinion you ought to take the ſpéeches <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> hath written vnto you, to be vſed by the lady <hi>Leonorine</hi> in good part and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your aduantage, for I dare warrant you on mine honour, that your affections are both alike: and to ſay the truth, ſhe hath behaued her ſelfe moſt wiſely to diſſemble the matter ſo well as ſhe hath done in the Emperors preſence. I deny not but ſhe hath
<pb facs="tcp:191458:77"/> ſome cauſe to be impatient, conſidering the meſſage I deliuered vnto her in your behalfe, but that is eaſie to be cured: &amp; although the loue ſhée hath borne you ſo long time ſhould be wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed (which I can hardly beléeue) euen as a bone that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in two péeces &amp; ſet togither againe, is ſtronger in that place than in any other part, ſo you being there and in her companie, ſhall winne that you finde broken, and by that meanes make it ſtronger than euer it was before. Therefore I am of aduiſe (that fulfilling her deſire) you goe vnto her, and that as ſoone as poſſibly you may. Alas <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) what good or what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice did I euer doe vnto her, thereby to haue deſerued at her hands the leaſt fauour among an infinite number I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from her? ſpecially by the report of your owne mouth. If therefore ſhee hath iuſt occaſion to be offended with me, hauing offended her ſo much, can I hope for any other at her handes than méere diſdaine and mortall hatred? My lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) I am a woman and know the nature of women better than you doe, or then all the men in the world beſides, I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beléeue me, and go and ſée her, and if ſo be ſhée entertaine you not according to your deſire, then neuer giue credit to my words againe. In faith my good companion (ſaid the king of Denmark) <hi>Carmelle</hi> giueth you ſo good and wiſe counſell, that either you ought to giue credit to her ſpéech, or els wholly driue this fantaſie out of your mind, conſidering (as is moſt true) that ſometimes, and very often, how much the more feruent and extreme the loue of a woman is, ſo much the ſooner is it dead and wholly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for that their inconſtancie is ſuch and ſo great, that for the leaſt occaſion in the world they are ouer ready to loue, and much more inconſiderately doe they forget the ſame againe: not that I accuſe the Princes <hi>Leonorine</hi> of ſo great lightnes, but to ſay the truth as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly we find, &amp; for my part I know not vpon what occaſion you ground your loue, wherby you ſhould make ſo much accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe neuer ſaw you, nor you her, but are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content to conceiue well of ech other vpon a certaine renowm y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ſpred abroad, &amp; ſet forth the great perfections y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be in you both: which in truth may bée compared to a fire

Truly (ſaid the Emperour) it is the goodlieſt preſent that euer I ſaw, and worthy the greateſt admiration: for although it be of incomparable riches, yet doe I eſtéeme it of no value in reſpect of the great ſcience and wonderfull knowledge that was in her to whome it firſt belonged, as ſhe maketh it well appeare by the threatnings ſhe vſed againſt vs in this table: God graunt all may fall out better than I doubt it will. My lord (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) although it be ſuch as you eſtéeme it, yet doe I feare that my Lady your daughter will not make ſo much account thereof, that in recompence of the ſame ſhe will acquite the good knight <hi>Amadis</hi> and the maſter that I ſerue, of the promiſe they haue made vnto her. I know not that (ſaid the Emperour) but I am well aſſured, that no earthly treaſure can be comparable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the valour &amp; vertue of your maſter: neither will I euer giue my conſent that <hi>Leonorine</hi> ſhall make that exchange, as deſiring the company of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> much more than to haue all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the world within my coffers: and with good reaſon, for that the wickedeſt perſon liuing on the earth may be rich of gold and ſiluer, but not of vertue, which is not aboundant vnto any but to thoſe that ſéeke it: wherefore if you thinke good, carry your preſents backe againe, for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> can not be acquited vnto vs but onely by his preſence.

In which diſcourſe, they grew into ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> had not béene there as witneſſe to their talke, conſidering the heat they then were in, I thinke not, but in time they would haue eaſily procéeded to a further matter. In that manner the two louers paſſed the night till day began to appeare: which quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> perceiuing, went to <hi>Leonorine</hi> and ſaid vnto her: Madame, the ſecreteſt follies are alwaies beſt, it is almoſt day, and it may bee the Empreſſe may ſend ſome one of her women, or come her ſelfe in perſon to viſit you, for that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternight very late it was told her you were not wel. I pray you giue this knight leaue to depart, and let vs ſhut him in the cheſt, as wee found him at the firſt. Alas how hard were thoſe wordes vnto <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and no leſſe vnto the Princeſſe, who foreſéeing the daunger that might fall out if they were found together, ſaid vnto him: My good friend, this happy night that hath fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs ſo much, ſhall cauſe you if you thinke good, to remember the promiſe you haue made vnto mee: I pray you let mée ſée you againe as ſoone as poſſible you may. And as ſhee ended thoſe words, the quéene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtood as a ſtout watch, heard ſome body come vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtaires, wherwith being in great fear, ſhe told y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onorine,</hi> which made <hi>Eſplandian</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other chamber, &amp; without hauing time to take any longer farewell, laid himſelfe

What aduenture? (ſaid he) Truly you may well tearme it ſo: for <hi>Gandalin, Enil,</hi> and I, thinking to ſaile vnto the caſtle <hi>La mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne defendu,</hi> fortune by tempeſt of weather, draue our ſhippe ſo néere this coaſt, that wée might plainly behold <hi>Belleris</hi> and his companie fighting againſt a great number of the enemie, that had driuen them among the rockes: whereupon we landed, and entred ſo farre among the enemies, that in the end the victorie was ours: after that by your nephewes counſell wee were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towardes Galatie, the which (as he aſſureth vs) will bée eaſily gotten without great reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, conſidering the ouerthrow

Let vs goe (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) and with that they followed <hi>Frandalo</hi> that went ſoftly before them, till they came vnto a litle hill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a mile of Galatie, from whence they might eaſily perceiue who iſſued or entred the towne: where they beheld great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of men as well horſemen as footmen, who being aduertiſed of the ouerthrow of their men, went to ſuccour them, thinking to find the chriſtians in the place where they had fought, but they were behind them: which the two knights (they had ſent out to diſcouer) perceiuing, ranne to aduertiſe <hi>Frandalo</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who being glad of the newes, went forward in great haſt, and ſuddainly ſet vpon the gates, where ſlaying the watch, they entred and tooke the towne, wherein there were none but impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and weake people to defend the ſame: which done, they drewe the Bridges, and went vpon the walles to kéepe watch, and to behold the enemies countenance at their returne, when they vnderſtood thereof, which was not long after, for a country man leaping ouer the walles, ranne preſently to aduertiſe them. If they were ſorry it is not to be doubted, for that beſides the loſſe of their goods, they loſt their wiues and children, thinking they ſhould all be ſent priſoners into a ſtrange countrey, whereat they were much gréeued: but one Knight among the reſt béeing a man of ſome ſtomacke, perceiuing their ſorrowe, badde them be of good courage, animating them in ſuch ſort, that they all determined either to looſe their liues or els to winne the towne againe: and therevpon (more mooued with rage than with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) they returned to the towne, and aſſailed it in ſuch furious and indiſcrete manner, that a great part of them loſt their liues in the aſſault, béeing repulſed and driuen away by <hi>Frandalo, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian, Enil, Gandalin, Elian, Tiron,</hi> and tenne other of the moſt principall Chriſtian knights: who to encreaſe more feare in the Galatians, iſſued out of the towne and ſlewe a great

For I hope not onely to driue theſe théeues out of my countrey, but to goe in perſon to ſpoyle and vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the cittie of Conſtantinople, with his wicked and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Emperour, and all the Chriſtian Monarchie. Which to bring to paſſe, it is not long ſince I ſent my Ambaſſadours vnto my friends and allies, who haue all giuen mée their promiſe to ayde and ſuccour mée with their forces and powers, whereof ſome are alreadie arriued at Tenedo, where wée (vpon certaine matters touching our countries) are to aſſemble togither: and ſtaying the time till I haue meanes to doe better for you, I will giue order that certaine mony ſhall be giuen you to ſuſtain your wants: For the which the citizens of Galatia thanking him moſt
<pb facs="tcp:191458:92"/> heartily, remaining in Teſifant, where they continually lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their great loſſes: on the other ſide <hi>Eſplandian, Frandalo,</hi> and the reſt of the knightes that had gotten the towne, conſidering with themſelues, that it would be impoſſible for them to kéepe &amp; defend ſo many places with ſo fewe men, agréed among them to ſend <hi>Gandalin</hi> to Conſtantinople vnto the Emperour, to ſhew him what they had of late done to <hi>Alphorax,</hi> and woon the towne of Galatie, being one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt famous hauens in all thoſe parts, and for that cauſe beſought him to ſend them. <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> or ſome other of his captaines, with ſome forces to aid them: otherwiſe they ſhould be conſtrained either to leaue Galatie or els Alfarin, conſidering their ſmall number and the continuall alarmes that the enemies gaue them, and the better to mooue him thereunto, they ſent him the greateſt part of the rich iewels they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in the towne. But they had neither Barke nor Pinnace ready to ſend, wherefore they were conſtrained to take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Eſplandian</hi> came thither: which at that time (as fortune would) lay ſtill at anker ſtaying their pleaſure. Wherewith <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſent <hi>Sergil</hi> to cauſe the ſhip to come thither: which done, &amp; <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> ready to imbarke himſelfe, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> tooke him aſide, &amp; ſaid vnto him: Friend <hi>Gandalin,</hi> you haue alwaies béene faithfull &amp; truſtie to my father, which giueth me cauſe to diſcloſe my ſecret vnto you before all others.

Then fare you well (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian.</hi>) With that <hi>Gandalin</hi> with all his charge entred into the ſhip, and hauing ſet ſaile, had a good wind, that in ſhort time after he arriued in Conſtantinople: where being lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he cauſed two ſquires to beare the preſents he had brought;
<pb facs="tcp:191458:92"/> and entring into the palace, he found the Emperor talking with diuers of his Noble men: the Emperor perceiuing him, went to imbrace him, aſking him where he had left the good knight <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and whether he meant not ſhortly to come and ſée him. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he commendeth himſelfe moſt humbly vnto your Grace, and hath ſent you word by me, that not aboue fiftéen daies paſt, hée, <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and others of our companie haue taken the towne of Galatie. Galatie? (ſaid the Emperor) By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith I beare to God, that is good newes: for as I haue béen informed heretofore, it is one of the richeſt townes in all Turkie, but I know not well how they can kéepe it. Full well my lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) ſo it be your pleaſure to ſend them ſome aid: otherwiſe they ſhall bee conſtrained in the end, either to abandon that to kéepe Alfarin, or Alfarin for that: which would bée a ſhame for them, and great dommage both to your Grace and all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Haue they found great riches therein (ſaid the Emperor) or haue they loſt any quantity of their men? My lord (ſaid <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi>) ſome of the enemies were ſlaine in the taking thereof: and with that he began to ſhew him the maner how it was done, and cauſing the caſes wherein the preſents were, to be opened, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other things he ſhewed him the images of <hi>Nabuchodonoſot</hi> king of Aſſiria, of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and that which he moſt eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the true and liuely repreſentation of <hi>Hector</hi> of Troy, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all points, as he was when he fought againſt the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and ſurely the Emperour had reaſon to make ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, for that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> was content to receiue it for his part, as being eſtéemed to be the richeſt iewell in all the citty of Troy, for that <hi>Hector</hi> himſelfe had cauſed it purpoſely to bée made while the Grecians lay before the citie, by one of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt workemen that could be found, and ſet it vpon the chiefe gate of the palace of Ilion, which long time after fell into the hands of the kings of Turkie, that had erected it in the market place of Galatie, placing it vpon a high marble pillar, which <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhewed vnto the Emperour, as he hard reported in the country: wherewith the Emperour was ſo well pleaſed, that hée could not refraine to ſay: In good truth I ſhould not be better
<pb facs="tcp:191458:93"/> pleaſed with the taking of the Citty of Teſifante, then I am at this time with this goodly Preſent, and I pray you tell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that ſent it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I thanke them for it with al my heart. My lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) ſo they did thinke it would bée more acceptable vnto your grace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the veſſels of gold and ſiluer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Towne, part whereof they haue likewiſe ſent vnto you, that are in this other caſe, which hée preſently cauſed to bée ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and after they had peruſed them, <hi>Gandalin</hi> cauſed the two ſlaues that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſent, to come néerer, preſenting them to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> ſaying vnto her: Madame, the good knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> not knowing what greater Preſent to offer you (next vnto himſelfe) then theſe two yong maids, hée ſendeth them vnto you as your ſlaues, to the end euery man may know, that as you are the goodlieſt lady that euer nature framed, ſo is there not any creature liuing on the earth, that better deſerueth to commaund ſuch as command others, then your ſelfe: wherefore if you ſhew him the courteſie to accept them at his hands, hee will eſtéeme it for one of the greateſt fauours that euer hee receaued. <hi>Leonorine</hi> that knew as well how to diſſemble her affections as any woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing on the earth: And deſiring to haue the ſame opinion, that alwaies had run of her, to continue ſtill, with a diſſembled kinde of anger, anſwered <hi>Gandalin</hi> and ſaid: Sir knight, it ſéemeth by your words, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> is diſpoſed to mock me, and that you eſtéeme me to be a woman of light credite, could you of your faith thinke me ſo very a child, that I ſhould not well perceaue, (that if <hi>Eſplandian</hi> were ſo much at my commaundement as you ſay) hee would not haue deferred the time ſo long to come hether vnto vs, were it only but to acquite the promiſe king <hi>Amadis</hi> his Father made vs aboue ſixe or ſeuen yeares paſt. But I knowe his mind full well, hée meanes to content vs with wordes, and many meſſages that from time to time hée ſendeth, together with an infinite number of excuſes, but all to no purpoſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of while I liue I will not accept one of them for his diſcharge: let him therefore come himſelfe, and then it may bee I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that to bée in him, I haue ſo oftentimes heard reported. When the Emperour heard her ſpeake in that ſort, hee ſhowed
<pb facs="tcp:191458:93"/> by his countenaunce that hée tooke great pleaſure at his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters choler, and ſaied vnto her: My ſwéet friend, what wil <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> ſay to ſée you ſo vncourteous towards him, that honoureth you ſo much: I pray you ſwéet heart moderate your colour, and take that hée ſendeth, for if you refuſe it, hée ſhall haue great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſlike thereof: And you ſée that for your ſake hee dooth ſo many valiant acts, that the good knight with the Gréene ſword could neuer doe the like. My lord (ſaied ſhee) I beléeue for valour hée is not inferiour vnto his father, but for courteſie his father ſurpaſſeth him. In faith Madame (ſaied <hi>Gandalin</hi>) if you knew him as well as I doe, it may bée you would commend him more then now you blaſpheame him, ſéeing that if hee hath deferred the time to come hether, it is onely becauſe hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hée hath not as yet done ſufficient in armes, whereby hee ſhould deſerue one ſparke of fauour at your handes, conſidering your eſtate and the ſmall valour that is in him, although at this day hée is eſtéemed the beſt knight that euer bare armes for theſe hundred yeares. Neuertheleſſe, ſéeing you accuſe him of that, that ought moſt to excuſe him, I promiſe you of mine honor, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all thinges apart, preſently vpon my retourne hee ſhall come hether vnto you, to doe whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to commaund him. <hi>Gandalin</hi> (ſaied the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi>) thinke not (whatſoeuer I ſay) that I either take pleaſure or diſpleaſure at his preſence or his abſence, but onely as my Father dooth, and I for his ſake, knowing the great loue and affection hée hath alwayes born to King <hi>Amadis</hi> his Father, and continueth the ſame to his ſonne. But hereof am I well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that hée cannot ſo excuſe himſelfe, or make vs thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then that herein hée hath done vs wrong. Neuertheleſſe, ſéeing it is the Emperours pleaſure, I will kéepe the Preſent hée hath ſent mée, vppon the promiſe and aſſurance you haue made of his comming hether as ſoone as you ſhall bee arriued at Galatia. Truely <hi>Leonorine</hi> played her part, very cunningly herein: for hardly would it haue béen thought or once imagined, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſhee had ſo faithfully giuen their handes and harts as they had done in the preſence of quéene <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> as you
<pb facs="tcp:191458:94"/> heard before, and <hi>Gandalin</hi> for his part knew not what to think, although he had borne <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in the tombe, and ſet him in hir chamber as you likewiſe heard. Then the Emperour aſked him how long hée meant to ſtay. My lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) as little as I may, for it were not fit for me to line at reſt, while my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions are in armes: Wherefore I moſt humbly beſéech your grace to giue mée my diſpatch as ſoone as poſſible you can. <hi>Gandalin,</hi> (ſaied the Emperour) I will preſently ſend for my admirall, &amp; wil cauſe men in al haſt to be prepared, that within ſixe or ſeuen daies they ſhall bée ready to depart. With that hee went into the Garden to recreate himſelfe, and the Ladies with him: where when <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> perceiued <hi>Leonorine</hi> in an herbor of Mirtle trées, walking penſiuely alone, hee went vnto her and ſaied: Madame, my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> commanded mee to certefie your grace, that ſince the time hee departed from you, and that he receiued ſo great fauour at your handes, his heart (that wholly is yours) hath ſo longed after you, that hee hath thought to die a thouſand times with gréefe, for the loſſe of your preſence. And to ſay the truth, I haue knowne many men troubled with the paſſions of loue: but I certainely beléeue there was neuer his like, nor that more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could diſſemble it, which maketh mee greatly to doubt his perſon. For that it is impoſſible, conſidering the gréefe hee ſtill indureth, together with the ſmall comfort hee receiueth of his familiar friends, (not knowing his diſeaſe) but that hee muſt in ſhort time end his daies: whereby great dommage ſhould then ariſe vnto all Chriſtendome, conſidering the ſtraunge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Knighthoode and great Proweſſe that is in him: which is ſuch, as that if hee continue as hee hath begun, he will bring that order in greater eſtimation then euer it hath béene before: wherefore Madame, ſéeing I haue alwaies (as it may bee you are alreadie aduertiſed) beene a ſeruaunt to his father, and that I am acquainted with the nature of his ſonne, and the daunger wherein hee is like to fall into, if you ſhewe him not ſome fauour, I haue preſumed to ſhewe your Ladyſhip the hard caſe wherein he was when I left him, as alſo that hee hath expreſſely commaunded mee to aſure you,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:94"/> that his only intent and deſire is to be in your preſence. Yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the danger wherin his companions do remain, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what excuſe to make, whereby he might take occaſion for to leaue them: wherfore he be ſéecheth you to impute his long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence vnto fortune, and not to him that is born only to loue, ſerue, and obay you. In vttering whereof <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhewed ſo ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a countenance, that hee made <hi>Leonorine</hi> ready to wéepe, In which kind of office hee had ſo well ben exerciſed from his youth, that no man could ſurpaſſe him in the ſame. Friend <hi>Gandalin</hi> (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi>) I know not what you mean I ſhould do for him more then already I haue done, nor yet for what cauſe you ſhould imagine that I ſéeke to be the means of his death: ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if he were but ſick, I know my ſelfe ſo féeble and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that with gréefe &amp; ſorow I ſhould not be able to liue one hour after. Let it therfore be far from you, once to thinke that I would euer be any other mans then only his: and think it not ſtrange, if in the Emperors preſence, or before the world, I diſſemble as I do, for I would not in any caſe, that the leaſt inckling of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning loue wherein my heart continually flameth towards him, ſhould as yet bee once perceiued, chéefly for the great good I wiſh vnto him. Madame (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) I am well aſſured hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an extream pleaſure to hear theſe newes, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil leaue all things to come hether, if you thinke it good. That is my deſire (ſaid ſhe) and I pray him ſo to do, and you to perſuade him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. While they were deuiſing, <hi>Tartarie</hi> the admiral (ſo called of the place of his birth) entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden: being a man iſſued of a mean houſe, but aduanced vnto great authority by his great wit &amp; valiant courage, ſo that he commanded ouer all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecian ſeas. The Emperor and hée talked long time touching <hi>Gandalins</hi> meſſage, concerning aid to bee ſent vnto Galatia, and in the end he willed in all haſt to prepare thirty gallies &amp; Foiſtes, with two thouſand of the beſt ſouldiers he could find to man the ſame. The admirall <hi>Tartary</hi> according to his charge, executed his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch ſort, that within ſixe daies after he was ready with his nauie to ſet ſaile, and depart from thence.</p>

Where talking together, <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhewed him from point to point what ſpéeches had paſſed betwéene the Princeſſe and him, not only before the Emperour, but alſo in the garden. And of my faith ſir (ſaied hée) you do her wrong, conſidering the good meanes you haue both to ſatiſfie her and your ſelf: for what excuſe ſoeuer you can make, you are not ſo ſore charged on this ſide, that you may not ſpare ſome time to goe and ſée her, which ſhee craueth at your hands. That I wil doe (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) but I muſt find the meanes; take you care for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) and let me go ſléepe, for I neuer had more néed: Goe (ſaid <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) &amp; be here again betimes in the morning. Wherewith <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke his leaue, leauing <hi>Eſplandian</hi> alone in great care how hee might find ſome conuenient excuſe to leaue his companions in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extreamity, but God prouided for him: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame night about an hour before day as he began to ſlumber, he heard a moſt pleaſant ſound of muſick,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:95"/> which you muſt vnderſtand, came out of the great ſerpent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee left in the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> which at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the town of Galatia, but little did he thinke of any ſuch thing, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Vrganda</hi> had ben therein, becauſe he thought her to bée in great Brittaine. This mellody continued for the ſpace of half an houre and more, which done, he heard ſuch a noiſe of trumpets Clarigals, Phifes, and Tabers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſounded ſo high, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſentinels of the town thought verily the enemies nauy had ben arriued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame to lay ſiege vnto it: wherevpon they cauſed an ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in the town, each man running to the wals, being all of that mind till day, when they might be hold the great ſerpent (wherein <hi>Vrganda</hi> was) all hung with long pennons and ſtreamers: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was ſo glad, that going downe vnto the Hauen, hee preſently entered into a boat with <hi>Talanque, Manely,</hi> and diuerſe other of the principall captaines to ſée who might bee there. And rowing néere vnto it, they knew <hi>Vrganda</hi> that ſtaied for them on the hatches, &amp; ſtretching forth her armes, ſpake vnto them &amp; ſaid: My good friends, you are moſt hartily welcome, I pray you come vp into my ſhip, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may imbrace you. With that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and as he meant to ſalute <hi>Vrganda,</hi> ſhe knéeled on the ground to kiſſe his féet, whereat he being aſhamed tooke her vp, and ſaied vnto her: Madame, I neuer thought you would haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to mock with me, ſéeing I account my ſelf much more bound to you then to any creature liuing in the world. And therfore for Gods cauſe, if at any time I chaunce to offend you, puniſh mee I pray you in ſome ſort or other. Moſt happy Knight, (ſayed ſhée) The aide I hope for at your hands before manie dayes ſhall paſſe, mooued mée to doe as I haue done, wherefore I beſéech you take it in good part. And with that ſhee embraced him, and after him, <hi>Talanque, Manely,</hi> and all the reſt, euery man doing her great honour, deſiring her to ſhewe them the cauſe of her ſo ſuddaine comming thether. My good friends (ſaied ſhee) you ſhal know it at ſome other time when better laiſure ſerueth: mean while I am to tell you that it is neceſſary for you ſhortly to go vnto the city of Conſtantinople, where you ſhall enter all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; apparelled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame armor I haue brought hither for you,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:96"/> and thus muſt I tell you, that if you ſhould deferre it till another time, it would be preiudiciall to you all. Wherfore I counſel you to do it vpon the firſt day of the next wéeke, aſſuring you to be as well receiued of the Emperor, as euer were any knights, which your eaſe and pleaſure in his company, ſhall continue vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whéele of Fortune turning about, ſhall bring with it manie trauels, paſſions, and aduentures, which ſhal cauſe many gréefes and ſorrowes both to you and others. And the better to make you beléeue that all I ſay is true, I tell you that I my ſelfe ſhall fall into two of the greateſt dangers of my life that euer I had, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee here or in another place I knowe not. And which is worſe, I cannot by any means auoid the ſame, not knowing any cauſe how nor wherefore it ſhould be ſo, although it be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ready to fall vpon mee. Madame (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) before you ſhall receiue any hurt in our preſence, wee will all loſe our liues to ſuccour you. My good child (ſaid ſhe) mans deſtiny of force muſt bee accompliſhed. But I pray you let vs enter into ſome other talke, for this maketh mee melancholy. Madame (ſaied <hi>Manely</hi>) Is it not your pleaſure to goe into the Towne? I (ſaied ſhe) and I pray you ſend for <hi>Norandel,</hi> who at this preſent I knowe is at Alfarin, and I wil giue you as great cauſe to reioice as euer you had: for that within my ſhippe I haue brought the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, wounded in a combate that hee fought againſt <hi>Garlante</hi> Lord of the Iſle of Calafre, that by force would haue taken two Gentlewomen from him. And although <hi>Garlante</hi> bee eſtéemed a hardy and valiant knight, yet did the king bring him in ſuch caſe, that vnleſſe hee had craued mercy, the king would haue ſtricken of his head: which he ſpared vpon condition, that during his life hee ſhould neuer after iniury any knight, which <hi>Garlante</hi> ſware and vowed in my preſence, for that by chance arriuing there, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their combate, I heard what paſſed betwéene tham. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perceiued the King to bee in danger of his perſon by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great number of wounds he had vpon his body, I would not leaue him, but cauſed him to enter into my ſhippe, and layed him in the beſt bed, where now hée is almoſt healed. Ha (ſaied <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi>) What good newes are theſe, of my faith I thought
<pb facs="tcp:191458:96"/> verily he had ben dead: wherefore madame, I pray you for Gods cauſe let mée craue the means to ſée him: with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Vrganda</hi> led him where he lay, but when they ſaw each other, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> could not refraine wéeping, with the great pleaſure hée took to ſée the king. Neuertheleſſe, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time they had no great ſpéech together, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would <hi>Vrganda</hi> permit them to do it, doubting leaſt the king (being yet but weake and féeble) might therby bée hindered of his health. Wherefore ſhe cauſed <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to go forth, and entring with her into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boat, they rowed to the ſhoare, from whence they led <hi>Vrganda</hi> to the beſt lodging in the town, with as much honor as they could haue done to the Quéenes <hi>Briſenne</hi> or <hi>Oriane,</hi> if any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ben there in preſence. The next day <hi>Eſplandian</hi> pitying the great number of women &amp; little children y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ben kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the town from the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaid to his companions, that it would be better to giue them leaue to depart from thence, then to hold them ſtil, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the longer they continued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town, the more charge they put them to: &amp; to kéep them priſoners (ſaied he) or in longer ſeruitude, God may poſſible be offended with vs. Wherfore if you wil beléeue me, vſing rather mercy then rigour towards them, I am of opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſend them al to Teſifant to the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> who wil thank vs for it, &amp; ſo ſhal we be ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To this al the knights agréed, &amp; <hi>Carmelle</hi> was appointed to execute the meſſage, &amp; he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſéen the great number of people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were about her, eſpecially women, wéeping moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to behold themſelues baniſhed &amp; driuen from their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſurely he could not chuſe vnleſſe he were hard harted, but haue pittied their eſtate. But let them goe, &amp; let vs heare what danger fell vnto <hi>Vrganda</hi> the next day after, who being welcome to the knights, took great pleaſure to hear them ſhew of the aduentures they had found in the Turkiſh countrey, ſince the taking of Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. And each man after the other diſcourſing what they knewe, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> remembred the old woman they had ſéene among the rocks, where ſhe continued, wherat he could not chuſe but ſmile, which <hi>Vrganda</hi> eſpying, aſked him the cauſe.

For ſhée is both doughter, ſiſter, &amp; aunt vnto a king &amp; is called <hi>Melie,</hi> who for to learn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect art &amp; ſcience of Nigromancy, hath ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the world, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for her inheritance ſhée hath choſen a rocke, wherein ſhe hath cauſed a caue to bee digged, where ſhée now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth &amp; liueth in great miſery, &amp; I ſwear vnto you of my faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is aboue twenty yeares &amp; more ſince I determined to come &amp; ſée her, but other affaires y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> touched me néerer, haue ſtill hindered my deſire. Madame (ſaied <hi>Eſplandian</hi>) ſéeing you are ſo néere, you may do it now, &amp; all we wil be your guides. I pray you let it be ſo (ſaid ſhe) &amp; let vs go as ſoon as we haue dined: which done, and the tables vncouered, euery man made preparation to goe with <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> to behold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſight: but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> would haue but thréeſcore with him, who being wel horſed &amp; armed at al poinis, iſſued out of Galatia, <hi>Vrganda</hi> on her palfrey, riding among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Belleris</hi> was their guide, &amp; when they came néer vnto the caue where they had found <hi>Melie,</hi> they eſpied her ſet croſſe-legged vpon the point of a rock, with that <hi>Vrganda</hi> praied them to ſtay, that ſhe alone might ſpeake ſecretly vnto her, which the knights agréed vnto. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe rode forward, &amp; being néere vnto her, ſhe ſaid: Madame, I pray you bee not offended that I come to ſée you, and offer you my ſeruice. Who are you? (ſaid ſhee) I am (ſaied ſhée) <hi>Vrganda la

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you come néer, and ſit downe by mée. <hi>Vrganda</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her to bée ſo old &amp; féeble, did as ſhee required, hoping by force to ſtay her there whether ſhe would or no, till her company were come thether, minding to giue her vnto them to bring her to Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, but ſhee met with as crafty a mate as her ſelfe, for the olde woman perceauing <hi>Vrganda</hi> to bée néere her, went to the mouth of her caue, and ſaid vnto her: <hi>Vrganda,</hi> It would gréeue me that theſe Knights ſhould heare our talke, wherefore let vs goe in. Whereat <hi>Vrganda</hi> made no difficulty, thinking verily, that if ſhe might once lay hands on her, ſhee would vſe her at her pleaſure: wherewith ſhée followed her, but ſhee was no ſooner entered, but <hi>Melie</hi> ſtepped to hir and held hir ſo ſtraight by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throat, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhée had no means to cal <hi>Eſplandian</hi> or any of the reſt to help her. But they fearing the worſt, ran in all haſt vnto the caue, and the firſt that entred was <hi>Talanque,</hi> &amp; after him <hi>Manely,</hi> and they had no ſooner ſtepped in, but they fell down as if they had béene dead, &amp; their fall was ſo great, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that followed them heard it, but hée had a remedye about him againſt all ſuch aduentures, and that was his good ſword, againſt the which no inchauntment whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer could ought auaile, which he firſt found to bée true when hée entred into <hi>Arcabonnes</hi> chamber: he perceauing his two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in ſuch caſe, being much gréeued thereat, willingly would haue reléeued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpied <hi>Melie</hi> holding <hi>Vrganda</hi> vnder hir knée, ſéeking by all means to ſtrangle her: which cauſed him firſt to ſuccour hir, threatning <hi>Melie</hi> if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe did hir hurt, ſhe ſhold déer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buy it, but for all his threatnings ſhee ceaſed not to vſe all the meanes ſhée could for to deſtroy her, vntill <hi>Eſplandian</hi> went neare vnto her, and with his ſworde thought to cleaue her head.
<pb facs="tcp:191458:98"/> wherwith ſhe began to flie, thinking to be ſafe within the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where ſhe wrought her charmes, but as ſhe ſtepped vpon the threſhold of the dore, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> caught her by the Beares ſkin, and whether ſhe would or not, held her ſo faſt, that ſhee could goe no further. And as hee lifted vp his arme to kill her, hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that hee ſhould doe wrong, thinking it not conuenient for a Knight to defile his hands in the blood of a ſimple woman, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt: and ſurely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thought of his, moderated his colour in ſuch ſort, that he purpoſed not to do it, minding only to draw her out of the vaut: wherewith hee tooke her by the haire, and pulled her with all his force. With that hee eſpied a great old Ape, with two eies burning like flaming fire, that lept vpon him for to tear his fleſh, but hee gaue him ſuch a blow with his fiſt betwéene the eies, that he ſtrooke him dead. And paſſing forward, brought <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> out of her caue, and leauing her in <hi>Frandalos</hi> kéeping, went in againe to ſée if <hi>Vrganda</hi> were aliue, where hee found her in ſuch pain, that it ſéemed the ſoule would depart out of her body, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he had ſo great pittie, that he tooke her in his armes, and ſet hir in the aire, the like hee did to <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manely,</hi> who within one quarter of an hour after, could not call to mind what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but were as whole and as wel as euer they were before. Wherefore they mounted on their horſes, taking <hi>Melie</hi> with them that ſat vpon <hi>Sergils</hi> horſe, and he behind her, holding her in his armes, leaſt ſhe ſhould eſcape. And God knowes with what ioy <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſhewed them what feare ſhe had ben in, which as ſhe ſaid was ſuch, that ſhe thought verily to die. But (ſaid ſhée) euen as one naile driueth out another, ſo the ioy I haue of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery, maketh mee in a manner to forget the paine wherein I was.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Armelle</hi> trauelled ſo long with the women and children of Galatia, that they arriued at Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifant, where they found both their fathers and huſbands as many of them as had ſaued themſelues, as it is ſaid before. Eſtéeme I pray you what gréefe they had to thinke vpon their exile, and loſſe of all their goods: Surely there is no heart ſo hard, but would haue wept with gréefe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold great numbers of men and women, with diuers litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren about them, and not hauing any meanes to giue them bread or drinke. Whereof the Prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> hauing newes, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their ſorow, could not refraine to ſay in preſence of them all. Ah immortall gods, it muſt néeds be, that either for ſome great ſinne of me or mine, this cruell warre is mooued in my countrey: O gods immortall, let your wrathes appeaſe, and of your infinite goodnes let it rather pleaſe you that all the miſchiefe which you ſend vpon thoſe impotent people fall only vpon mée that alone haue mooued your indignations: if not, then I beſéech you giue me grace, that to your glory I may driue theſe curſed Chriſtians (enemies of your holy lawes) out of my countrey, ſwearing vnto you, that if you vouchſafe your aides, I will make ſo great a ſlaughter of them, that thereby your wrathes ſhall bée appeaſed, if it be ſo that the ſmall indeauour I haue hither to vſed to driue them hence be the occaſion of your anger towards me. Then hée aſked them how they got away. My Lord (ſaid hée that brought him newes) a faire gentle woman named <hi>Carmelle</hi> (as I heare ſay) hath brought them hither, and deſireth to ſpeake with you and the princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe.</hi> Ladie (ſaid <hi>Alphorax</hi> to his
<pb facs="tcp:191458:99"/> wife, doe you know her? I my lord (ſaid <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) for ſhe bare me company all that day that I fell into <hi>Frandalos</hi> hands, being very ready to do me all the pleaſure and ſeruice that ſhee could deuiſe: wherefore my lord, I pray you let her haue that honour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement ſhe deſerueth. Lady (ſaid <hi>Alphorax</hi>) I am wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith. With that ſome of them ran to fetch <hi>Carmelle,</hi> who being come in preſence of <hi>Alphorax,</hi> went preſently vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Heliaxe,</hi> and without ſalutation, ſaid vnto her: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, you know the lord and maiſter that I ſerue, who only hath aucthority ouer me, think it not therefore ſtrange, if in any ſort I haue not humbled my ſelfe before the prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> or to you: And to the end Madame, that you ſhould knowe the cauſe of my arriuall here, I thinke the taking of Galatia is not vnknowne vnto you, whereof at this preſent the Chriſtians are Lords and maiſters, hauing conquered it from you by force, not finding any Garriſon therein, but a number of women and little children: which my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> &amp; his company ſend vnto your grace, committing them vnto your good diſcretion. Aſſuring you (their Religion onely excepted) they are ready to doe you any ſeruice that they may. <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaied the Princeſſe) this is not the firſt fauour they haue ſhewed vnto me, I am of long time ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them, that bee it in their aduerſities or their proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I will neuer bee vnmindfull of the ſame. Neuertheleſſe, I am aſſured, that at this day I haue not, neither yet ſhall euer haue the meanes to doe it, (as I thinke) vnleſſe that variable fortune turne her rouling whéele, and abaſe them as much as now they are aduaunced, then (if it ſo fall out) they ſhall full well perceaue, howe much I eſtéeme their vertues and fauours they haue ſhowne vnto mee. <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaied <hi>Alphorax</hi>) haue they willed you to deliuer no meſſage vnto mee? No my lord (ſaied ſhee) but I tell you plaine, they are determined verye ſhortly to come and viſite you, in ſuch manner, as will not greatly like you. By all my gods (ſaied <hi>Alphorax</hi>) I will eaſe them of that burthen, if they make not the more haſt. For I haue ſo many men preparing, that I meane to goe in perſon to Conſtantinople to deſtroye the wicked Emperour

Nowe Madame (ſayed ſhee to <hi>Heliaxe</hi>) I haue done the commaundement of thoſe that ſent mee hether, wherefore I beſéech you let mee be ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the place from whence I came. My lord (ſaid the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to <hi>Alphorax</hi>) I pray you ſhewe her ſo much fauour, for it would gréeue mée much that ſhée ſhould receaue the leaſt iniurie in the world, which hee graunted vnto her: and withall <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe</hi> gaue her for her paines one of the richeſt gownes ſhee had. Wherewith ſhee cauſed her to bee conducted by twenty knights vnto the Towne of Galatia: where being arriued, ſhee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them what ſhee had done, as alſo what ſpéeches the Prince <hi>Alphorax</hi> vſed vnto her, which <hi>Vrganda</hi> marked well, ſaying vnto the Knights: In faith my good friendes, as touching <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorax</hi> high woordes, they are the fruites of his nature, being altogether prowd and arrogant: Neuertheleſſe, I can aſſure you, that fortune promiſeth him great matters. And becauſe it will not bee long before they doe happen, I will nowe vſe no wordes of them: Praying ſome of you to ſhewe mee ſo much fauour to retourne againe vnto <hi>Melies</hi> caue, to fetch her Bookes that wée left behind vs. Which being in my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it may bee they will ſerue hereafter to doe both you and manie others pleaſure. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hearing <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſpeake with ſuch affection, and knowing the deſire ſhee had to haue the bookes, anſwered her and ſaied: Madame, before I ſléepe I will ſée if I can fulfill your pleaſure.

Wherefore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was in mind to trie their fortune, and to ſend one of their ſquires in all haſt vnto Galatia, to aduertiſe them of the danger they were in, that they might ſuccour them: whereto <hi>Frandalo</hi> would not giue conſent, ſhewing what great paine and trauaile both they and their horſes haue endured all that day, as alſo the great number of their enemies in regard of them, in ſuch ſort (ſaid he) that if we take vpon vs for to fight with them, I am in doubt, that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to winne honour, we ſhall be counted raſh and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fooles.

<pb facs="tcp:191458:102"/> thought to incloſe <hi>Enil,</hi> but he found means to recouer the bridge: ſurely whoſoeuer had ſéen the great proweſſe of thoſe four cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, might with good reaſon eſtéeme them as they were, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that ſtroke not one blowe in vaine. And although they were but fewe in compariſon of their enemies, yet they did twice or thrice ouerthrow diuers of the Turkes that ſéemed bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to aduenture forward, in ſuch ſort, that had it not béene for the footemen that came vpon them, the horſemen had but little preuailed: whereat it is not to be maruailed, becauſe the greateſt part of them were citizens, altogither vnexpert in armes, and fitter to banket at a table than to guide a horſe or breake a lance: whereby in leſſe than a quarter of an houre the foure knightes had done them great hurt: and ſo much, that neither the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nor footmen durſt once ſet forward to enter vpon the bridge, till one of them determined to make proofe, thereby if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to incloſe them round about. This Turkes name was <hi>Tlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acam,</hi> a valiant and hardy knight, as he well ſhewed before the combat ended: for although the water was déepe and the other ſide hard to clime vp, yet he waded through, and at diuers times bare eight more of his companions ouer: which <hi>Frandalo</hi> and the reſt perceiuing, they were conſtrained to deuide themſelues, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> ſtaying at the end of the Bridge where the combat firſt began, <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſtanding at the other, and God knowes what trouble they had, for <hi>Tluacam</hi> deſirous to winne honour or to looſe his life, with his lance in hand, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Gandalin</hi> in ſuch ſort, that both man and horſe had like to fallen to the ground, and withall he brake his ſpeare: wherfore taking his ſword in hand, ſtriking on both ſides, and thinking to be ſeconded by his fellowes, put his horſe in ſuch a fury, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or not he bare him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle of the bridge: where thinking to ſtay, the horſes féet ſlid from him, whereby both hée and his maſter fell into the riuer and were drowned: whereat the Turkes gaue ſo great a crie, that they ſéemed madde, and bowing downe their heads thinking to acquite their loſſe, vſed all the force they could on both ſides the bridge to enter vpon the foure knightes: who ſuſteined their aſſault ſo brauely, that the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:102"/> Turkes at laſt were forced to recule, wherof nine were thrown into the water, but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his company were ſo weary, that in a manner they could fight no longer. With that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their aid in all haſt comming towards them: the occaſion why they ſtayed ſo long was becauſe <hi>Frenace, Frandalos</hi> ſquire, that went to ſéeke <hi>Manely</hi> and the reſt, thinking to find his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter where he left him, had led them thither, but not finding them there, ſuppoſed them to be gone vnto the bridge: and to ſay truth, they arriued in very good time, for that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his thrée companions were almoſt cleane out of breath: but when they perceiued their aide, neuer did poore priſoners that were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie more reioyce, nor were better pleaſed: and the Turkes on the contrary ſide neuer more aſtoniſhed, yet they held cloſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, determining rather to reuenge their deathes than once to yéeld vnto their enemies: ſo that before the Knightes of Galatia could enter in among them, they gaue them much to do, although in the end they ouercame them, whereby not one eſcaped aliue, to carry newes vnto their friends. <hi>Enil</hi> at the firſt onſet had béen ſore wounded, as you heard before, wherefore hée cauſed his wounds to be ſearched: the like did the reſt of the hurt knights. Which done, they ſet forward to Galatia, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for that day with the victory it had pleaſed God to ſend them. And comming to the gate, they found <hi>Vrganda</hi> readie to receiue them: who knowing how all had paſt, and the daunger wherein <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had béen, ieſtingly ſaide vnto him: In faith my Lord, ſaid ſhée, if I were afraid of death when I fell into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> hands, I beléeue you were not in much better caſe ſince that I ſaw you laſt, as I vnderſtand by thoſe that know what dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage you were in. Madame (ſaid he) I know I am a mortall man, and that my life and death are in the hands of God, as it pleaſeth him to diſpoſe, and I confeſſe vnto you, if wée had not béene ſuccoured, that in the end we could not haue endured: yet am I well aſſured, that before it had come to paſſe, we had laid ſo many enemies on the ground, that the reſt ſhould haue had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe to lament their loſſe, than boaſt of their conqueſt. <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> perceiued by <hi>Eſplandians</hi> words that he liked not her ſpéech,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:103"/> whereupon ſhee ſaid vnto him: My Lord, pardon me I beſéech you, and excuſe the indiſcretion of a woman, ſpecially in mée, who at this preſent had forgotten my ſelfe. Madame (ſaid <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>) you may command me, and likewiſe ſet me forth for a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, hardy, or any other what it pleaſeth you to tearme me. In which manner talking togither, they came vnto his lodging, where maſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (newly come from Alfarin) viſited his wounds, and the reſt likewiſe that had cauſe to vſe his helpe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:191458:103"/> ſpecially to ſée <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and you, of whome I haue receiued great pleat pleaſure, perceiuing at my arriuall the loue and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is among you, with the great deſire you haue to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the order of knighthood: not for the glory and recompence of this world, but onely for the increaſing of our faith and the ſeruice of God, that ſhall reward you for it: and to the end you may continue in this forwardnes, and that the thing which I pretend, may happily fall out, I will from henceforth not only imploy my perſon but my Arte, which hath pleaſed God to lend me, wherewith I will aduiſe you what I ſhall find conuenient and neceſſarie for the augmentation of your honours alreadie ſpread throughout the world: which to begin I am of opinion, that you all imbarke your ſelues with me in the great ſerpent, that ſhall bring vs vnto Conſtantinople to the Emperour, for without him it is impoſſible that this great enterpriſe you haue taken in hand can come to good effect: as alſo that hee himſelfe before many yéeres are paſt, ſhall be found in maruellous neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and ſuch, that he ſhall account himſelfe moſt happie to haue your aid: and with good reaſon, for that in the end both hee and you ſhall ouercome thoſe hazzards according to your deſires. Then ſhall you plainely knowe, that this that I foreſhew vnto you is moſt true. While <hi>Vrganda</hi> vſed theſe wordes, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſtood ſtill intentiue for to heare her: and had it not béen that they eſtéemed her words to be moſt true, they had doubted of the threatnings ſhée vſed againſt the Emperour, he béeing ſo great and puiſſant a Monarch. Neuertheleſſe the iſſue of that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which ſhée aſſured vnto them, gaue them ſome eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of minde: in expectation whereof, they made account in the meane time to prooue their ſtrengths and forces, that thereby their valour and magnanimitie might be further ſpread abroad. And as touching their voiage to the Emperour, as <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi> gaue them direction, it was onely the thing wherevnto <hi>Eſplandian</hi> did aſpire, hoping that if the warres were openly proclaimed in the Grecian Empire, and the Emperours daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo imminent, to ſhewe ſuch valour and proweſſe in martiall exploits, that hée would not onely frée and acquite his father
<pb facs="tcp:191458:104"/> of the promiſe he had made to ſerue the Ladies, but confirme the loue that the princes <hi>Leonorine</hi> bare vnto him, in ſuch ſort, that he might obtaine her for his wife: which cauſed him to ſpeake for all his companie, aſſuring <hi>Vrganda</hi> that not one of them but was readie to obey and goe where it pleaſed her. My friends (ſaid ſhe) then I pray you to morrow in the morning cauſe your horſes to be ſhipped in my ſhippe, and for armour take you no care, I will prouide you thereof ſo well, that ech man ſhall find himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: let it ſuffice you to imbarke your ſelues and ſet ſaile: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times an enterpriſe deferred ouer long, falleth not out as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſire it ſhould, not for want of good and wiſe counſell, but by the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe that are appointed to execute the ſame. Thus was their voiage to Conſtantinople agréed vpon, in ſuch ſort, that all the knights of great Brittaine entred into the great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, taking with them <hi>Frandalo, Melie,</hi> and the captaine of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifant that had béen taken priſoner, as you heard before, leauing the Admirals ſouldiers for garriſon in the towne.

They were in all fortie knights, whoſe names are as followeth: <hi>Eſplandian, Frandalo, Norandel, Talanque, Manely</hi> the wiſe, <hi>Ambor</hi> of Gandel, <hi>Grauate</hi> of the fearfull valley, <hi>Gandalin, Enil, Trion</hi> couſin to quéene <hi>Briolanie, Brauor</hi> ſonne of the giant <hi>Balan, Belleris, Elion le delibere, Lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> of the white Tower, <hi>Liſtoran</hi> of the ſiluer bridge, <hi>Landin</hi> of Sariaque, <hi>Imoſil</hi> of Burgondie, <hi>Ledadrin</hi> of Ferraque, <hi>Sarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> couſin to <hi>Angriotes, Palomir, Branfil, Tantiles</hi> the proud, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi> ſonne of <hi>Iſamel, Carpin</hi> his brother, <hi>Carin</hi> of Carante, <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> ſonne of <hi>Oliuas, Bracele</hi> ſonne of <hi>Bandoyuas, Garamante</hi> ſonne of <hi>Norgales, Amphinio</hi> of Almain, <hi>Brandonie</hi> of Fraunce, <hi>Pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> of Spaine, <hi>Flamene</hi> his brother, <hi>Culſpicio</hi> of Bohemia,

Being arriued, the ſhippe was preſently eſpied by the citizens which they knewe, hauing ſéene it before when it put them in ſuch feare, as you haue heard, but hoping for him that vſed ordinarily to ſaile therein, they all ranne vnto the walles, and along the ſhore to ſée him land: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the noiſe and rumour was ſo great, that the Emperour had newes thereof béeing as then talking with the ladies.

In faith I neuer thought vpon the firſt of thoſe two points, and much leſſe am I in doubt of the ſecond, for you know as much as my ſelfe, and yet I am not ignorant that when the great ſerpent was there where I now behold it, he whome we expect came not thither, wherefore I feare (and with good reaſon) that wée ſhall now be ſerued in like ſort: and as ſhe ended her ſpéech, the ſhippe came within a bow ſhot of the hauen where they might perceiue one of her ſides to open, from whence they put out a boat, and not long after they ſaw <hi>Carmelle</hi> and two other gentlewomen come forth, the two gentlewomen playing moſt ſwéetly vpon two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which they did till they arriued at the ſhore: from whence they went vnto the Emperor, who knowing <hi>Carmelle,</hi> had better hope to ſée <hi>Eſplandian</hi> than euer he had before: &amp; going vnto her to aſke what newes, ſhe made no more reuerence vnto him than ſhe vſed at other times to do, ſaying vnto him: My lord, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> my maſter (that you ſo much deſire to ſée) is now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the town in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ſerpent with diuers other knights
<pb facs="tcp:191458:105"/> his friends and allies, and <hi>Vrganda la diſogneue,</hi> deſiring you to ſhew them the fauour to ſtay in your pallace, where they meane to come and viſit your grace. Truly <hi>Carmelle</hi> (ſaid the Emperor) I neuer heard meſſage in al my life that pleaſed me ſo wel, I am content to do as they deſire, although I was determined to méet them, and to giue them that entertainement they deſerue: But ſéeing they will haue it otherwiſe, I will ſatiſfie their deſires. That is ſufficient (ſaid <hi>Carmelle</hi>) we will then retourne to them againe, to certefie your graces anſwere. Goe (ſaid the Emperor) and tell them from me, that they ſhall be moſt heartily welcome. With that <hi>Carmelle</hi> with the two Gentlewomen departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Hauen: meane time, whoſoeuer had beheld the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> might eaſily haue iudged the alteration of her heart, it was ſo full of ioy, that without Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to refraine, ſhe would peraduenture haue done done ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby her honour had been blemiſhed, minding to leaue the Empreſſe her mother, and goe to méete <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had procured ſo great ſorrow in her mind. But the Quéene as a wiſe and diſcréet lady perſuaded her ſo much, that ſhée ſtayed at the window, whereby her alteration might not be perceaued. <hi>Carmelle</hi> ſtaied not long, but went into the boate, rowing to the great ſerpent, where being entered, there were preſently two boats more put forth, that brought horſes to land, which don, they returned again to fetch the knights, &amp; thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would went forth, and among them ſix gentlewomen, thrée of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſounding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ceaſing, the other thrée plaied on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lute and vials, in that manner being landed &amp; mounted on their horſes, they entred into the Citty, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixe Gentlewomen marching firſt, after them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Turkiſh captaines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were taken at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſiege of the caſtle <hi>La mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne defendu,</hi> then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captain of Teſifant, next followed <hi>Armato,</hi> &amp; with him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſe <hi>Melie,</hi> apparrelled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beares ſkin as ſhée had ben taken, then followed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forty knights two in a ranke, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med horſe &amp; man in one ſort of armour, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of them road <hi>Vrganda,</hi> talking to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Denmarke. And as they approched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallace, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empreſſe, and the ladies met the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor comming to <hi>Vrganda,</hi> did her as much
<pb facs="tcp:191458:105"/> honor as if ſhe had ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt quéen in the world. Mean time the knights being among the Ladies, gaue occaſion to bee found no leſſe courteous, then prompt &amp; valiant in armes, ſpecially <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> who comming to the princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> knéeled on the ground to kiſſe her hands, but ſhee refuſed it, making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany beléeue, ſhe was offended with him for delaying the time to come vnto the court as he had promiſed. Which the Emperour perceiuing, could not refraine to ſmile, and ſaied vnto her: How now daughter? Is this the good entertainement you ſhewe vnto your knight, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thankes you giue him, for comming expreſſely hether to ſerue you? I pray you call to mind, that he deſerueth a better countenance, were it only for his fathers ſake, to whome you are ſo much beholding. My lord (ſaid ſhee) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe I am ſo much offended with him, for if he reſembled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréen ſword as much in curteſie as in countenance, he had not ſtayed ſo long to obay his fathers wil, &amp; to ſatiſfie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you &amp; I haue made vnto him by <hi>Carmelle</hi> and others, as your grace kneweth. Before God (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor) you ſay true: yet I could neuer haue ben perſuaded you would conceiue diſpleaſure ſo long time, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring what he hath done, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rich preſents he ſent to you. My lord (ſaid ſhe) if he hath done any thing for me, it was without my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, I had rather he had done leſſe in thoſe things, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée had ben more obedient to his fathers wil &amp; mine. Madame (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor to <hi>Vrganda</hi>) you ſée in my daughter how great y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> choler of an angry woman is. My lord (ſaid ſhe) ſhe hath reaſon ſo to do, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Eſplandian</hi> obeying his father, ought to confirm himſelf both to her wil &amp; yours. And hauing failed therin, all he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath done for her ſake, may be accounted nothing, although I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the remembrance of my lady your daughter hath made him (being in fight) enter into ſuch danger, that it was moſt ſtrange howe hee could eſcape. Wherefore Madame (ſaid ſhee to <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norine</hi>) he deſerueth pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſame, &amp; ſo I pray you grant him. While <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſpake, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes beheld <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with ſo great affection, that in a maner ſhée liued and died in him: and he for his part by hir felt in what ſort loue vſeth thoſe he holds in his power. Wherby ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued a long time without anſwering <hi>Vrganda,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:191458:106"/> not for any euill will to her in vſing of thoſe ſpéeches, but rather féeling ſuch alteration in her mind, that ſhe trembled like a leaf. But in the end ſhe remembred her ſelfe, and ſaied vnto her: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſéeing it is your pleaſure that I remit his offence, I am content to doe it, vpon condition, that if hée forget himſelfe as hée hath done heretofore, you ſhall beare the puniſhment for him. With that ſhe tooke him by the hand, and made him riſe vp, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſpéech, becauſe the Empreſſe (that in the meane time talked with the king of Denmarke) came thether, whereby <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was conſtrained to leaue the Princeſſe, and ſalute her. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror al that while had giuen no entertainement to king <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> as knowing him not, but when they ſhewed him which was he, he imbraced him and ſaid: My lord and brother, I beſéech you pardon my ignorance, in not entertaining you before this time, as not knowing you, but I will amend the fault when you think good. My lord (ſaied <hi>Armato</hi>) I am now (as it pleaſeth fortune) in place where you may command me, yet I pray you call to mind who I was, and what I may bee, and doe for me as you would I ſhould do for you if your caſe were mine: Conſidering with your ſelfe, that the like hard fortune may fall on you, and that it is no leſſe vertue to intertain the vanquiſhed courteouſly, then to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the puiſſant enemie. With that the Emperour led him into his pallace, the reſt following after him, and when they were in the hall, hee left them with the Empreſſe to ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and taking him aſide, ſaied vnto him: <hi>Frandalo,</hi> to let you knowe howe well I do account of the great good ſeruice you haue done for mée, I will that from henceforth you ſhall bee my chéefe ſtandard bearer, in which place I nowe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you. For the which <hi>Frandalo</hi> thanked him moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, accounting himſelfe moſt happye to haue ſo great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLIII. How Norandel and Queene Minoreſſe fell in loue one of the other, and what conference they had together.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Emperour being among his Knights, making them all the cheare and honour that hee could deuiſe. It happened that the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine</hi> and Quéene <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe</hi> ſéeing the king of Denmark and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randel</hi> together, called <hi>Carmelle,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her who they were. My Ladies (ſaied ſhée) you haue ſéen him that hath the leaſt beard here before, (which is the king of Denmarke) for hee came hether with <hi>Frandalo,</hi> the other is <hi>Norandel</hi> king <hi>Luiſarts</hi> ſonne, eſtéemed for one of the hardieſt knights liuing on the earth. I pray you (ſaid the Princeſſe) deſire them to come hether, that wée may ſpeake with them. With that <hi>Carmelle</hi> called them vnto her, and as they were before the two Princeſſes, the more they beheld the excellency of their beauties, the more they maruailed at it, and not without cauſe, for next vnto <hi>Leonorine</hi> there could hardly be found in all Gréece one that matched quéene <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> eſpecially in comelineſſe and good behauiour, but if ſhee had ſome perfection in her, nature had not forgotten her ſelfe in forming the two knights, eſpecially <hi>Norandel,</hi> who till that time had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer felt the ſtings of loue, no more had Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, that little théefe ſurpriſed them ſo couertly, that hee bound them both, making them captiues one to the other, in ſuch manner, that after many Queſtions and Anſweres propounded they drew themſelues apart, leauing the king of Denmarke tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> the Quéene aſking <hi>Norandel</hi> what hee thought of the Princeſſe. Madame (ſaid hée) although I haue heard her eſtéemed for one of the goodlieſt ladies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, yet did I neuer thinke her beautie had béene ſuch as now I ſée it is, although you are little behinde her in that reſpect, whereby I
<pb facs="tcp:191458:107"/> might eſtéeme my ſelfe moſt happy if I had ben aſléepe that day I enterpriſed to take my iourney hether. Wherfore (ſaid the quéen) haue you had ſo ill intertainment in this court? No madame (ſaid he) but there is one hath ſtollen that from me which I haue moſt carefully kept during my life. The Quéene not knowing what he meant, was thereat abaſhed, aſking him what it was, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew the théefe. I madame (ſaied he) and it reſteth in you to do me iuſtice, if it bée your pleaſure: for you &amp; none other haue that whereof I ſpeake. In good faith (ſaied the Quéene) you ſhall pardon mee, for I haue nothing of yours that I cam remember. Madame (ſaied <hi>Norandel</hi>) ſince the time I firſt did knowe what belonged to a man, I kept my liberty, not alienating it to any one: But comming hether (I had no ſooner ſet mine eie on you) but I found my ſelfe of a fréeman a bondſlaue and captiue to your ladiſhips good fauor: which I beſéech you afore me, in recompence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty you now haue taken from me. Truly ſir knight (ſaied ſhe) you haue at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t run too far aſtray, for if you beheld me as you ſhould, you had not found me ſuch a one as you ſay, &amp; wold haue ben twice aduiſed to vſe ſuch ſpéeches as you do. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I will not take them at your hands (being a ſtranger) in ſo euill part as mine honour doth require, and I think likewiſe you ſpeake farre otherwiſe then you meane: which ſhe ſaid to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him, thereby to ſée if <hi>Norandels</hi> words were ſpoken from the heart, who hearing that ouerthwart anſwere, was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, but being moued with loue, anſwerd her and ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, pardon my boldneſſe I beſéech you, but I ſweare vnto you, by the faith of a knight, that I haue diſcouered the ſecret of my heart: and if you will not beléeue me at this time, I hope in time to come to doe ſo much, that you ſhall well perceiue what great deſire I haue to bee your Knight, if it will pleaſe you to graunt mee ſo much fauour to accept mee for the ſame. When Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> perceaued him ſo earneſt, as that in vttering thoſe words hee ſhewed great affection, ſhee eſtéemed in her minde to haue ſufficient argument that might perſuade her to beléeue his wordes, wherewith ſhee anſwered him and ſaied: My lorde <hi>Norandel,</hi> If you doe as you promiſe, I well beléeue that you
<pb facs="tcp:191458:107"/> ſay: and for the accepting you to bee my Knight, mee thinketh I ſhould doe wrong to refuſe ſo ſmall a fauor to ſo courteous a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as you are: wherfore I both grant it and deſire it of you. With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe took a litle ring (ſhe commonly wore) off from hir fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, giuing it vnto him for a witneſſe of their new confirmed ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And had it not ben y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor was ready to go to ſupper, they had no ſooner left talking, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empreſſe went in, whereby quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> was conſtrained to follow after, taking <hi>Melie</hi> &amp; <hi>Carmelle</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hir, to whom ſhe did al honor &amp; good intertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhe could deuiſe: ſupper being don, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tables vncouered, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onorine</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſéen <hi>Norandel</hi> &amp; quéen <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> talking w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great affection, doubted ſome feathers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind, wherefore taking her aſide, ſaid vnto hir: Couſin, I beléeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intertained you ſo long, told you ſome news out of great Brittaine, or ſomthing els y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pleaſed you ful wel, I pray you fair lady tel me what it was, for you were very earneſt to harken thervnto. How now madame? (ſaid ſhe) ſince when I pray you, did you learn to mock? cal you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mocking (ſaid ſhe) which is don in earneſt? I pray God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mockery I mean to you may fal out as I deſire it wold: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal I at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt haue as good adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage at you, as you haue had at me, which wold pleaſe me wel, not ſo much to haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mine own eſtate, as to yéeld you in excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like pleaſure I haue receiued at your hands, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you firſt were made acquainted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue betwéen <hi>Eſplandian</hi> &amp; me. Wherfore fear not to vtter your mind vnto me, otherwiſe I wil from henceforth haue you in a iealouſie, for that you haue already done, or yet would doe. Madame (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quéene) rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhould do ſo, I wil declare to you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecreteſt thing I know. The knight (ſaid ſhe) wherof you ſpeak, (I know not by what means) hath ſo captiued my mind, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I féel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing in my ſelf which I neuer thought could haue happened to me. And as they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are moleſted with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual ague, do find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taſt of water better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of life to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo I likewiſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was accuſtomed not only to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temn the force of loue, but blame al ſuch as yéeld to his might, (eſtéeming their eſtate rather voluntary then forcible) finde my ſelfe ſo much ſurpriſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if God help me not, I am in the greateſt danger y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer poore woman was. What (ſaid the princeſſe) think you my lord <hi>Norandel</hi> is of ſo hard a heart, and little courteſie, as
<pb facs="tcp:191458:108"/> that hee would diſdaine the loue of ſo faire and comely a Lady as you are? Doe you perceiue by him, that his mind is placed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? No madame (ſaied ſhe) but to the contrary, hee proteſted to be wholly mine, without any further aduantage, then that I haue accepted him for my knight. Truly (ſaied <hi>Leonorine</hi>) I am glad thereof, and if you had done otherwiſe, he might ſurely haue complained, and you much more to haue refuſed ſo great a good, when it is offered without diſſimulation: elſe if it bée otherwiſe, it is no good, but rather a curſe. I am of this opinion (ſaied ſhee) that my lord <hi>Norandel</hi> would rather die a thouſand deathes then beare that mind: Wherefore determine I pray you to vſe him well, aſſuring you, that I will not faile to ſuccour you in what I may, and will doe for you as you haue done for mée. So long they talked together, that the Emperour and his company riſen from the table, came to ſée the ladies. Neuertheleſſe, neither the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe nor Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> could haue the meanes to entertaine their friends, but onely with a looke, whereby (their hearts pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their bellies) were ſome what eaſed: when night appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, euery man withdrewe him to his reſt, but when Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> found her ſelfe alone, and in her bed, ſhe began to think vpon the ſpéeches that <hi>Norandel</hi> vſed vnto her, ſometimes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to aſſaie, if by any meanes ſhee could driue the ſame out of hir mind, and then preſently changed thoughts, and ſaied vnto her ſelfe: Alas, was there euer greater conſtancy in a woman, then that I alwaies had vntill this time? Muſt I nowe of force yéeld vp the fort, that againſt ſo many hard aſſaults I held inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible? Alas, I nowe perceiue it is of force, wherefore it is better preſently to ſéeke for remedy, then to conſume thus ſecretly as I doe. But what? if I chaunce in this ſort to yéeld vnto mine own deſire, (poore ſoule that I am) then doe I manifeſtly perceiue the danger wherein I fall, and the thraldome that I bring my ſelfe into, from whence while I liue, I ſhall neuer eſcape. Wherefore it were far better for mée to bridle mine owne affection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that which commandeth me, then do that which hereafter I might repent. With that ſhee held her peace, and tourning on each ſide, like one not well at eaſe in body nor in mind, ſhe had no
<pb facs="tcp:191458:108"/> ſooner reſolued one thing, but preſentlye diſſolued it againe, ſo great was her inconſtancy therein. Neuertheleſſe, hauing well debated with her ſelfe al the pleaſures or diſpleaſures that might cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e thereby: In the end, with a lowd voice ſhee vttered theſe words: I knowe not what may come to paſſe, but Loue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me great things: Wherefore if the worſt fall out, and that from henceforth I forget my ſelfe, hee ſhall beare the blame, and not I, that will doe nothing but vnder his protection: In which opinion, ſhe fel aſléepe, and the next day <hi>Norandel</hi> and ſhe finding meanes to talke together, they confirmed their loue in ſuch ſort, that they determined to vſe the ſame more by wiſedome, then by paſſion: which thoſe that are in like caſe, ought to follow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to attaine vnto the point of their deſired ioyes, which in times paſt before, was commonly called the gracious gifte of Mercy.</p>

With that <hi>Leonorine</hi> and quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> thought ſhe would haue ſpoken of the knight <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that had béen put into a Cedar cheſt, as you heard before: wherewith they béeing ſurpriſed with a deadly feare, began to behold each other in moſt pitifull manner: which <hi>Vrganda</hi> well perceiuing, intending to eaſe their mindes, continued her diſcourſe in this manner: My lord (ſaid ſhée) this prophecie was written concerning <hi>Matrodo</hi> lord of the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> who as you knowe was alwaies a Pagan till his latter day that he became a Chriſtian, whereby long time he continued a bondſlaue of the bond of ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for ſuch ought the ſea of Idolatrie to be named: but <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> perceiuing his repentance, ſuffered him to be buried in the hermitage, where as yet <hi>Carmelles</hi> father doth remaine: who ſince that time hath ſo much honoured the giants body, that ſhée hath buried his bones within the Cedar cheſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you madam (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Leonorine</hi>) if you do remember, gaue vnto her: &amp; touching theſe lines which containe theſe words, <hi>That life ſhal be reſtored by him that ſuffered death:</hi> that is likewiſe to be vnderſtood of him, for that looſing this tranſitorie life, he hath obtained the eternall in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome: ſo great grace hath he receiued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of God by the merit of his ſonnes paſſion, in whome he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, as I ſaid before: &amp; ſo my lord (ſaid ſhe) you haue heard what I can ſay as touching this ſtrange prophecie. I but (ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) what meanes the reſt? My lord (ſaid ſhe) I can tell you
<pb facs="tcp:191458:109"/> no more of it than can my lady your daughter or quéene <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe,</hi> but ſo much can I aſſure you, that in ſhort time you ſhall ſée it come to paſſe: and if in any point it concerneth you, the beſt is it will all fall out to greater good of your ſoule, than to any power or worldly glory: wherwith for this preſent I pray you content your ſelfe. I truly (ſaid the Emperor) &amp; ſo will I alwaies do: for ſo my ſoule be well I eſtéeme not the miſery of torments of my bodie. And with that he left <hi>Vrganda</hi> with the Empreſſe, &amp; went into the hall, where great number of knights &amp; gentlemen ſtaied for him: with whome hée paſſed the reſt of the day in all pleaſant delightes: meane time fortune by little and little began to play her part, and to ſpread the nets wherewith ſhe meant to incloſe that troupe, thereby to worke the enuie and great tribulations that afterward fell vpon them: the beginning whereof was ſuch as you ſhall here. About a mile without the citie, the Emperor had built a ſumptuous pallace, called <hi>Vaelbeniatnof,</hi> as like to that of <hi>Apollidon</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firme Iſle as well could be deuiſed: which place was compaſſed with a parke furniſhed with all things requiſite for mans delight, whither hée meant to lead the ladies, with <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his companie, as alſo king <hi>Armato,</hi> to feaſt them in the ſame, and for that purpoſe within thrée daies after their arriuall, they departed from the citie of Conſtantinople, and went to Vaelbeniatnof, going into the parke, wherein they found the hunters, and at their firſt entrance a great Hart was ſingled out, which in the end after long chace was killed almoſt before the ladies: &amp; going further, they eſpied a bore ſo fiercely hunted by dogs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they made him turn, &amp; with his tuſkes ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dogs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none durſt ſet vpon him: but at the laſt one of the hunters ſtrake him in the throat, &amp; ſo he died: ſo long this ſport endured, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper time drew on, wherfore the lords &amp; ladies entring into the palace found the tables couered, &amp; ſitting downe, were ſerued in moſt ſumptuous maner: &amp; hauing ſupped, they began to daunce, which continued till midnight, minding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day to begin their ſport againe: but fortune minding to beare a part, did ſo trouble the feaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe gaue them well to vnderſtand, how ſhe can worke in all things at her pleaſure: for the next day about euening the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:110"/> knights and ladies being in the Parke, ſome talking with thoſe to whom they bare affection, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenting their mind with ſuch deuiſes as loue to paſſe the time in pleaſure, put into their heads, others running about and taking pleaſure to gather floures, and doe as moſt delighted them. <hi>Melie</hi> (from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> till then they could not heare one word) went vnto <hi>Vrganda,</hi> &amp; before them all ſpake vnto her and ſaid: Madame, I maruell (if it be ſo that your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſkill be ſuch as is reported) why you make no ſport vnto this company. <hi>Melie</hi> (ſaid <hi>Vrganda</hi>) where you are preſent I wil not vndertake to doe it before you, but you ſhould rather doe it, being well aſſured, that the Emperour would bee thankfull for the ſame. If it pleaſed him (ſaid ſhe) I am content, vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that after me you do the like, or better if you can. Truly (ſaid the Emperour) it is but reaſon: and I pray you both to doe it. My lord (ſaid <hi>Melie</hi>) then command <hi>Vrganda</hi> to lend mée a booke that I was wont to haue, whereon the picture of <hi>Medea,</hi> (&amp; her name written ouer it) dooth ſtand, then ſhall you beholde ſome of mine art, and if <hi>Vrganda</hi> neuer knew it before, ſhe may learne it now of me. In good faith (ſaid <hi>Vrganda</hi>) that wil I not deny you: with that ſhe called one of her Gentlewomen, willing her to fetch the booke: meane time <hi>Melie</hi> tooke king <hi>Armato</hi> by the hande, and making as though ſhe would ſpeake a word with him, they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a while together, then they ſat them downe hard by the place where the empreſſe and the ladies were talking with ech other, and ſtaying til the thing <hi>Melie</hi> had requeſted, were brought the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which not long after <hi>Vrgandas</hi> Gentlewoman brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, ſhe hauing it in her hand opened the booke, and then began to read, making certaine ſignes with her eies lifted vp to heauen and calling <hi>Vrganda,</hi> praied her to come thether, ſaying ſhe ſhold ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee neuer had ſéene before. <hi>Vrganda</hi> not doubting any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by <hi>Melie</hi> prepared, went and ſat downe by her, and next her king <hi>Armato,</hi> ſo that ſhe ſat betwéene <hi>Melie</hi> and him, where <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> began to turne the booke, ſhewing them certaine propheſies, and other ſtrange deuiſes, which continued not long but the aire began to be couered with a round blacke cloud, and there with it ſéemed ſo darke, that they could not ſée each other, at the laſt the
<pb facs="tcp:191458:110"/> cloud opened, and they beheld two horrible dragons comming downe out of the cloud that drewe a waggon, and ſtaied right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Vrganda,</hi> who by <hi>Armato</hi> and <hi>Melie</hi> was ſo ſtraitly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that whether ſhee would or not they thurſt her in, and they after her. Wherwith the dragons ſéeing their waggon charged, flewe vp into the aire, and carried them away, <hi>Vrganda</hi> crying for helpe, but all in vaine: for in leſſe than the twinckling of an eye ſhe was out of ſight: wherwith there was ſuch noiſe among the company, that <hi>Eſplandian, Talanque, Ambor, Manely,</hi> and the reſt of the knights that came thither with her, ſware neuer to reſt aboue one night in a place before they found her out: ſo that the ſame day taking their leaues, both of the Emperor and others that by them were left in ſorrow, they entred againe into the great ſerpent, but before <hi>Eſplandian</hi> went, he ſpake vnto the princes <hi>Leonorine,</hi> beſéeching her not to take in euill part his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe taken in hand for the loue of her, to whome he found him ſelfe ſo much beholding, promiſing her that preſently (hauing found <hi>Vrganda</hi>) hée would returne againe. My good friend (ſaid ſhée) me thinkes you ſhould doe this at better leyſour, and not in ſo great haſt as now you doe: yet am I well content to doe as pleaſeth you: but forget not I pray you (ſaid ſhée) to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as you haue promiſed. Which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> vowed vpon his faith: meane time <hi>Norandel</hi> and quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> (as much grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as might be) knewe not what countenance to holde, hauing their hearts ſo ſeaſed with care, that the Quéene was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to withdrawe her ſelfe into her chamber, and lay vpon her bedde, ſhutting the doore: whereby <hi>Norandel</hi> had no meanes to take his leaue, but imbarked himſelfe, charged with an infinite number of gréefes and ſorrowes: with that the great ſerpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of it ſelfe to ſet forward, and within two daies after arriued at the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Dragons bearing <hi>Vrganda, Melie,</hi> and king <hi>Armato</hi> in the aire, flewe ſo ſwiftly, that before day they were right ouer the citie of Teſifante, where they ſet downe their charge: that done, they flewe away, and neuer were ſéene againe: king <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was excéeding glad when he perceiued himſelfe to be in place whereas he might commaund, and went vnto his pallace, where finding the guard, he made himſelfe knowen vnto them, that preſently went to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the prince <hi>Alphorax,</hi> who much abaſhed at thoſe newes, ſtart out of his bed, and caſting a furred gowne vpon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ranne to imbrace his father, who ſéemed to be ſo changed, not onely becauſe his beard was longer than he vſed, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great gréefe and melancholly he had ſo long endured, that the prince began to wéepe, and ſay vnto him: My Lord, you are more than heartily welcome, for Gods cauſe I beſéech you tell vs how fortune hath béene ſo much your friend to deliuer you out of the miſery wherein you haue continued ſo long, to my no little griefe. Sonne (ſaid he) <hi>Melie</hi> can tell you better than my ſelfe, for ſhe is the only meanes of my good hap, and hath brought with her <hi>Vrganda diſcogneue,</hi> (of whome heretofore you haue heard.) And as he left ſpeaking, <hi>Melie</hi> and <hi>Vrganda</hi> entred into the hall, wherewith the rumor of the kings returne was ſo great within the Citie, that all the people ranne vnto the palace for to ſée him, being as glad of his arriuall, as <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſorry to ſée her ſelfe in ſuch a place, and that which gréeued her more, was that <hi>Melie</hi> in preſence of them all, ſpake vnto her and ſaid: <hi>Vrganda,</hi> two things mooue me to ſaue thy life: the one, for that in my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
<pb facs="tcp:191458:111"/> thou haſt not once ſuffered an euill word to be vſed to me, neither permitted that any man ſhould doe mee harme: the other becauſe I certainly know that king <hi>Armato</hi> hath by thy means receiued all the good intertainement he had, during his hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. Neuertheleſſe, the miſchiefe thou haſt procured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this country (being the only cauſe the Chriſtians entered into the ſame) is ſufficient to make thée indure perpetuall impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wherein by mine art I will ſo ſtraightly incloſe thée, that thy Art ſhal nought auaile thée euer ſo get forth. But although that ſentence might well abaſh <hi>Vrganda,</hi> yet ſhee ſhewed ſuch conſtancy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe neuer changed colour, determining w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her ſelfe to indure whatſoeuer ſhould fal out, wherfore ſhe ſaid vnto <hi>Melie:</hi> Madame, you may do with me as pleaſeth you, but in reaſon you ought not to vſe me otherwiſe then you your ſelfe were vſed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had the like authority ouer you, as you haue now of me, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhal do wrong both to your ſelfe &amp; me: To me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> am olde &amp; ancient, putting me in priſon, wherewith you threaten me, (not hauing offended you,) &amp; to your ſelfe, in preferring cruelty before the curteſie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ben found in you: whereto <hi>Melie</hi> anſwered hir not a word, but commanded her to be ſhut into a great tower ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Vrganda</hi> knew without Gods help, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her euer to come forth: yet ſhe liued in hope, conſidring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mutability of fortune, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king <hi>Armato</hi> himſelfe had ben caſually deliuered, who continued certaine daies in his great Citty of Teſifant, without making any ſhew to bee reuenged. But in the end he ſent Embaſſadours to all the Princes in the Eaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were his allies and confederates, deſiring them to enter into arms, not onely to driue the Chriſtians out of Galatia, Alfarin, and other places that they had vſurped in his countrey, but to deſtroy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople with all the Chriſtian monarch, and therefore wrote a letter vnto them, the contents whereof doe follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Armato,</hi> by the prouidence of our immortall gods, called to the gouernment of the puiſſant country of Turky, the frontier &amp; Bulwark of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pagan land, to all caitifes, kings, ſoldiors, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals &amp; gouernors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countries ſcituated in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eaſt parts, ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
<pb facs="tcp:191458:112"/> gréeting, being returned out of priſon, from whence we are now deliuered, I thought good to giue you to vnderſtand, that not long ſince there is a knight come out of the South into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, deſcended (as men ſay) of the race of <hi>Brutus</hi> the Troiane, to whome for our iniuſtice (as it is verie likely) our gods haue giuen power to conquer the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> ſlaying <hi>Matroco</hi> and <hi>Frerion,</hi> two of the beſt Knightes in all the Eaſt parts: and which is worſe (the number of the Chriſtians increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more and more) they haue fought all meanes to deſtroy our holy lawe: which to preuent, we entred into armes, and hauing raiſed a mightie armie, thought to driue them out of our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but hauing long time continued ſiege before the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> and brought it to ſuch extremitie, that they had no victuals to ſuſtaine themſelues, he of whome we were moſt in doubt, the firſt beginner of thoſe warres, found meanes by the aid of a villaine named <hi>Frandalo</hi> (that ſometime belonged vnto vs) to enter therein, and by ſubtiltie to take vs priſoners, in ſuch ſort, that our army being ouerthrowne, we remained priſoners in their handes, where they haue holden vs in ſtraight kéeping almoſt for the ſpace of a whole yéere togither: meane time our fortune continuing worſe and worſe, they haue by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeazed vpon the townes of Alfarin and Galatia, two of the beſt portes in all our Realme: which they had neuer taken in hand without the aide of the traiterous and diſloyall Emperour of Conſtantinople: who for to aid and ſuccour them, hath falſly broken the truce concluded betwéen vs, and raiſed ſo many men, that without your aides, we are in danger to fall into their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, a thing that would concerne you much, ſéeing we (as you know) are the frontire and rampart to you all. Wherefore in the name of all our gods, wee pray and deſire you, that not onely for the ſafegard of our law, but for the profit and vtilitie of all the Eaſt countries, you will aſſemble your forces in ſo great number, that thereby we may driue theſe Chriſtians out of our countrey, and conquer the Empire of Conſtantinople, euen to Fraunce, and the countries of great Brittaine, which will be both eaſie and profitable vnto vs. Theſe letters written and the meſſengers
<pb facs="tcp:191458:112"/> diſpatched, they made ſuch haſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of Iuly following, there were ſo many men aſſembled at the port of Tenedos, that the Chriſtians had newes thereof, as hereafter you ſhall heare. One day among the reſt as <hi>Belleris, Talanque,</hi> and <hi>Manely</hi> being iſſued out of the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> hoping to take ſome Turke in the way to Teſifant that might tel them news, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of king <hi>Armato,</hi> but of <hi>Melie</hi> &amp; <hi>Vrganda,</hi> as day began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare came vnto the aduenturous fountain, where they beheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pillers of braſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pauillion, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field bed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Heliaxe</hi> had left there, with a great ſerpent lying therein, which preſently began to run away, and the knights after, thinking to kill her, but their horſes durſt not go néere her, yet ſhe began to complain and wéep as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly as a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trauelling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> child. Wherewith there appeared four men wel mounted &amp; armed at al points, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cried out and ſaied: Sir knights, depart frem hence &amp; trouble not our gentlewoman in this ſort, or it ſhall coſt you your liues. And ſcarſe had they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their ſpéech, but they ran ech at other, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrange knights brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their ſpeares in ſuch maner vpon the Chriſtians, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Manely</hi> and his companions thought they had run againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with long ſtrawes. Yet could not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couch his launce, but ran their courſe without once touching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mean time, the ſerpent entred into a hole, and could no more be ſéene, &amp; as they turned their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to run another courſe, the four knights would not abide, but flying away, cried vnto them and ſaid: Sir knights, our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman is ſafe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t your ſelues if you think good. Get you hence to al the deuils (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) and ill fortune might he haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> followeth after you. With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thrée returned vnto the fountain, not without great laughing at their aduenture. And as they were before the pauillion, they perceiued a knight that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his horſe, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Belleris</hi> riding, aſked him his name: What haue you to do therwith? (ſaid he.) So much (ſaid <hi>Belleris</hi>) that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhal tell me preſently w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good wil, or els ſhal ſight w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me. You ſhal faile in the one, but not in the other: for although you bée thrée, yet am I well content to prooue what the knights of great Brittaine can doe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Talanque</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo boldly, he could not refrain to ſay: By God ſir knight, that ſhall you prooue
<pb facs="tcp:191458:113"/> without delay, &amp; ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, ran fiercely againſt the other that refuſed him not, but ſtrake him ſo ſure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ouerthrew him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. Which <hi>Manely</hi> wondring at, ſet forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his friend: but if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ſped ill, he ſped no better, no more did <hi>Belleris:</hi> all thrée riſing vp againe, aſhamed at their fals, which minding to amend by dent of ſwords, the other knight fled along the wood, crying ſo lowd, that they might heare him ſaie: Sir knights, another time ſit better on your horſes, and trouble not your ſelues to follow me, if you meane not to loſe your way. In Gods name (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) what may this mean, ſhall wée haue no better fortune all this day, I thinke wee are inchaunted. Let vs mount vpon our horſes and follow after him, that wee may knowe whether God or all the diuels in hell haue determined to croſſe vs in this iourny. Wherewith they mounted, determining to follow after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, but they heard a lamentable voice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtaied to ſée what it might bee. With that they eſpied a woman with her head vndreſt, crying out for helpe: And after her ran a lion ready to deuour her: whereat they being mooued with compaſſion, thought to ſtep betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the lion began ſo horribly to rore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the horſes ſtricken with fear, bare their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters aboue two long bows ſhot from thence: meane time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the lion vaniſhed away, whereat <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manely</hi> more abaſhed then before, aſked <hi>Belleris</hi> if euer hee heard of ſuch adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures. In good faith (ſaid he) thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are deſirous to ſée ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge things, muſt repaire vnto this fountaine: For there are manie (&amp; ſuch as yet you haue not ſéene) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonder it is to hear, &amp; wil you know how it commeth to paſſe? <hi>Melie</hi> had deuiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> long time ſince, wherfore it is not to be maruelled. No more I doe not (ſaid <hi>Manely:</hi>) neuertheles, were it not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enterpriſe we now haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand, by the faith of a knight (ſaid he) I would not depart from hence before I had ſéene them all. That ſhall bée at another time (ſaid <hi>Belleris:</hi>) let vs now kéepe on our way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they held on the left hand, alwaies riding tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the citty of Teſifant: &amp; hauing ridden about fiue miles ſpace, they met ten men on horſeback all vnarmed, leading two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, one of them being ſomewhat faire and well apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<pb facs="tcp:191458:113"/> But the ten men were in ſo great fear, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leauing the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, they ran and ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues not being purſued, for the thrée knights ſtaied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gentlewomen, of whom they hoped to hear ſuch news as they deſired. And in effect, after they had ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſſured them, they aſked them what news of king <hi>Armato,</hi> and whether he were ſtil priſoner. My lords (ſaid the eldeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman) it is not long ſince hee eſcaped out of the Chriſtians hands, and is returned vnto Teſifant with <hi>Melie,</hi> that hath ſhut <hi>Vrganda</hi> in a tower, from whence ſhe ſhal neuer depart without her leaue. That is good newes for vs then (ſaid <hi>Belleris:</hi>) and what hath king <hi>Armato</hi> done ſince his returne? Doth he not (ſaied he) meane to bee reuenged on them that kept him priſoner ſo long? I truly (ſaid ſhe) for all the kings, Souldans, Cailiffes, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Pagan law, haue promiſed him to arriue at Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, and to deſtroy all Chriſtendome.

And as they were in debating of the matter, <hi>Creſcelin</hi> nephewe to the Admirall of Gréece, (that not long before had ſtollen tenne Gallies from the Emperour to roue vpon the ſea) came to aduertiſe the Knights, that as he ſailed into Phrigia, he had diſcouered in the iſle of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedos, ſo many Gallies, Foiſtes, and other veſſels, of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that the ſea ſéemed couered therewith, who without doubt aſſembled to ouerrun the Emperour &amp; deſtroy all Chriſtendome: wherefore (ſaid he) I thought to let you vnderſtand the ſame, not onely becauſe you might prouide for them, but alſo to deſire your fauours to entreate the Emperour in my behalfe: aſſuring you, that if hee pardon the offence I haue committed againſt his maieſty, I will fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth do him ſo good ſeruice, that he ſhall like it well.

Thus did the Emperour take care to prouide for his affaires: and <hi>Norandel</hi> meane time to gouerne <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> who minding to trie him like gold within the fornace, one day among the reſt ſhewed him a harder countenance than vſually ſhe did, faining ſhe had receiued newes that he loued a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in great Brittain: wherein <hi>Norandel</hi> by all meanes ſought to excuſe himſelfe: but the more he ſéemed conſtant, ſo much more did the Quéene make him beléeue ſhée thought the worſe of him: wherewith he was in ſuch perplexitie, that hee could not chooſe but ſay: In faith madame, as farre as I perceiue, you meane to end my daies, for the wrong you do me is ſo great, that it can not well be iudged but by ſuch as know your crueltie: and yet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I beare you is ſo great, that neither I nor any other can well expreſſe the ſame, if preſently they doe not ſhew the beauty and perfection wherewith nature hath adorned you. Wherefore eſtranging me from your wonted fauour, I perceiue my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhorten, wherewith I am not grieued, were it not, that dying, I ſhould looſe the meanes to doe you ſeruice, but not the benefite of loyaltie: for whether I liue or die, the ſame ſhall ſtill accompanie my ſoule vnto the place of reſt. Which wordes when <hi>Norandel</hi> had vttered, the tears trickled down his chéekes. Whereat Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> tooke ſuch pitie, that forgetting her diſſimulation, with a ſmiling countenance ſhée anſwered him and ſaid: My good friend, I now beléeue you well, and therefore I pray you pardon my indiſcretion: for ſo it is, that this that I haue done, hath béene onely to auoid the meanes that ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you to attempt the ſame. Now I well perceiue your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie (according to my counſell at your laſt departure hence) remember I beſéech you how neceſſarie diſſimulation is to ſuch as are infected with the like diſeaſe: I meane, it ſhould not bée

               <p>My lord, the danger I ſée prepared againſt all Chriſtendome, conſtraineth me to ſend this meſſenger vnto you, by whome at large your Grace may vnderſtand how great and puiſſant an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie all the Kings and Potentates of the Eaſt (enemies of our faith) haue lately raiſed, by the perſuaſion of <hi>Armato</hi> king of Turkie, therwith to ouer-runne not only the Empire of Greece, but all the land of Chriſtendome, and wholly to extinguiſh our faith and holy lawe. And for that all thoſe of whome you hold the place, haue alwaies béene the true defenders of the Chriſtian faith, as alſo that the caſe toucheth you ſo néere, I am of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe (my lord) that you ought to ſpare neither mony nor men, but to aſſemble your forces in all haſt, and prepare your veſſels to aid and ſuccour the good prince, who is the frontier (as you knowe) both vnto you and all the potentates that hold the law of Chriſt. I write the like vnto the king my father, and to the moſt part of all the Chriſtian Lordes, to whome I ſend <hi>Gandalin.</hi> And for that <hi>Enil</hi> hath in charge to certifie your grace by word of mouth, what it ſhall pleaſe you to demand, I will not trouble you with many lines, beſéeching you to giue credit vnto him, as to my ſelfe. The like he wrote to the king of Sardaigne: which two meſſages <hi>Enil</hi> had in charge: to whome he gaue ample inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and remembrances of all the aduertiſements and ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences he had receiued from the Turkiſh coaſt: not onely of the number of men both on horſe and foot; but alſo of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their veſſels and other warlike inſtruments: commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Gandalin</hi> to goe with him till he came vnto Cicilia, where he ſhould prouide ſhipping to ſaile into great Brittaine to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> his father, and from thence to France vnto king <hi>Perion,</hi> then to Sobradiſe to <hi>Galaor,</hi> likewiſe to king <hi>Bruneau,</hi> to <hi>Quedragant, Dragonis,</hi> and <hi>Goſquilant:</hi> to whome he ſent like ſeuerall letters: <hi>Gandalin</hi> carrying them likewiſe the ſame inſtructions that <hi>Enil</hi> had vnto the Emperour, commaunding them expreſly to aſſure them all, that he would not depart from the caſtle <hi>La montaigne
<pb facs="tcp:191458:116"/> defendu,</hi> before their arriuall there, but meant to kéepe it while breath was in his body. <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Enil</hi> had ſo good and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous a weather, that in leſſe than fiftéene daies after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they paſſed the countrey of Meſſine, and landed at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragource, where <hi>Gandalin</hi> hired a Brigandine to execute his charge. And to the end you may vnderſtand what effect their meſſages did worke, I will leaue <hi>Gandalin</hi> trauerſing the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teranean Sea, and entring into the Ocean, and ſpeake of <hi>Enil</hi> that arriued at Oſtre, where as then he found the Emperour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with king <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> deuiſing onely of haukes and houndes: but when they eſpied <hi>Enil,</hi> preſuming he brought ſome ill newes, they aſked him where hée left <hi>Eſplandian: Enil</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to behaue himſelfe, kiſſed the letters, and gaue one to the Emperour, the other to the king of Sardaigne: which hauing read, and perceiuing them to be of credit, tooke him apart where hee diſcouered vnto them all you heard before. With that the Emperour leauing <hi>Enil</hi> with king <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> went vnto the gentlemen and knights that then were preſent, and ſaid vnto them: My friends, wée muſt all to the warres: my nephew <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> hath aduertiſed me (by this gentleman expreſſely ſent vnto me) that the king of Turkie and all his allies are in armes, and haue raiſed a mighty armie to aſſaile my brother y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor of Conſtantinople: but I vow to God (if he giue me life &amp; helpe) that before the moneth of September next enſuing, I will be there with ſuch a force, that I will make him twice repent how hee ſo raſhly dooth aſſaile, and learne him to defend himſelfe. Wherefore let euery man bée ready, for I will goe my ſelfe in perſon: and calling king <hi>Floreſtan</hi> he aſked him if hee would goe with him: My lord (ſaid he) to morrow I will ſend to all my ports &amp; hauens, that all the ſhips of war that can be found may be in a readines: meane time I will in all parts aſſemble men to doe as my nephew <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hath required. My Lord (ſaid <hi>Enil</hi>) my lord <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hath written by <hi>Gandalin</hi> to king <hi>Amadis</hi> and other of his friends, whome he hath deſired to ioyne with you, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I hope about one time all your armies wil be ready, &amp; that wiihout long ſtaying for each other, you will aſſemble all togither. Truly (ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:191458:117"/> king <hi>Floreſtan</hi> it was well deuiſed. With that diuers captaines were diſpatched into ſundry places to giue order for their men, and to ballace, rigge, and prepare veſſels for their voiage into the Eaſt. <hi>Gandalin</hi> on the other ſide coaſting the Iſles of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorque and Minorque, leauing Guinea and Barbarie, paſſed the ſtraits of Gibraltar, and had ſo good a wind, that in fewe daies without ſtaying in Spaine, hée arriued in great Brittain with king <hi>Amadis,</hi> who as then continued in London, and preſented him with the letter that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſent, ſhewing him likewiſe his charge by word of mouth, the good and euill aduentures that he had had ſince he departed from Myrefleur, and among the reſt the ouerthrowe of the Turkiſh armie on the ſea, the taking of king <hi>Armato,</hi> the occaſion why the ſiege roſe vp before the caſtle <hi>La montaigne defendu,</hi> the arriuall of <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> the taking of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farin, and of the captaine of Teſifant, the ſurpriſing of Galatia, the loſſe of <hi>Vrganda:</hi> and laſtly all what you haue read at large in the chapters going before. And to the end my lord (ſaid he) that order may be had to preuent the inconuenience he foreſéeth to be prepared againſt all Chriſtendome (if it be not ſuccoured) he hath expreſly willed me to ſhew you, that he hath had certaine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that all the kings of the Eaſt parts haue ſworne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, togither to ouerrunne all Chriſtendome: which is verie likely, conſidering the great preparations and aſſembly of men they haue alreadie made in the Iſle of Tenedos: which is ſuch, that as our ſpies report, they are at leaſt ſixe hundred ſayle of ſhippes, and about foure or fiue hundred thouſand men. God will helpe vs if it pleaſeth him, ſaid king <hi>Amadis,</hi> for my part, I will doe what poſſible I may, and will like wiſe aduertiſe king <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> my father and my brother <hi>Galaor.</hi> My lord (ſaid <hi>Gandalin</hi>) I haue alſo charge to trauaile vnto them, and likewiſe vnto <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillan, Don Bruneau, Quedragant,</hi> and others, to whome <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> hath written in like ſort as he hath done to you, and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly giuen me in charge to ſée king <hi>Luiſart,</hi> and doe his humble commendations vnto him. It is great reaſon (ſaid the king:) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I am of this opinion, that before my mother y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quéene you doe not once declare the occaſion of your comming, but giue
<pb facs="tcp:191458:117"/> her to vnderſtand that all is well, but not vnto the king, if you find him alone: for he is a man (as euery one well knoweth) to take all things with patience as they ſhall fall out: and becauſe my ſonnes affaires require no delay, I pray you <hi>Gandalin</hi> after you haue refreſhed your ſelfe a day or two, goe on your iourney as you haue in charge. So <hi>Gandalin</hi> that day remained there, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time Quéene <hi>Oriane</hi> talked long with him: the next day he departed to ſée King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and Quéene <hi>Briſenne</hi> at Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur, who knowing he came of meſſage from <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> were excéeding glad: the Quéene although ſhée were wiſe and verie aged, yet could not change her womans nature, but before the king ſpake any word aſked him for her ſonne: but <hi>Gandalin</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed readily to deuiſe excuſes, as hée had béen inſtructed by king <hi>Amadis</hi>) tolde her that he had left him in the firme Iſle not well at eaſe by reaſon of his long trauell, but not ſo ill (ſaid he) as that he could not haue taken paine to come hither &amp; ſée you, but he feared leaſt his ſicknes would encreaſe: wherefore he thought it better for him to kéep his chamber a while, than to entertaine a long and enuious ague for a long ſpace: which the quéene eaſily beléeued: and for the hope ſhe had ſhortly to ſée him, ſhe made no account thereof: neuertheles, the ſame euening <hi>Gandalin</hi> tolde king <hi>Luiſart</hi> all that you heard before, wiſely excuſing himſelfe of the ſpéech he vſed before him vnto the Quéene, as king <hi>Amadis</hi> had giuen him charge: wherein king <hi>Luiſart</hi> commended him, &amp; for the reſt he promiſed to thinke theron while he trauailed vnto thoſe with whome he had to doe. In this ſort <hi>Gandalin</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, returned to king <hi>Amadis,</hi> who in the mean time (perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by quéen <hi>Oriane</hi>) wrought a marriage for him, as you ſhall heare. You haue read in the beginning of our hiſtory of the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the gentlewoman of Denmarke did for them, and the things wherein ſhe &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> had béen exerciſed: wherefore it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that hauing béen partakers of their youthful toies, ſhe ſhould alſo taſt ſome of their proſperous fortunes. Wherefore quéene <hi>Oriane</hi> moued king <hi>Amadis</hi> to make a marriage betwéen them two, but he thought the match vnfit, becauſe the gentlewoman was already aged, &amp; <hi>Gandalin</hi> being yong and luſty: neuertheles,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:118"/> as all women that are wiſe and of a quicke conceit, can bring their enterpriſes to effect, the Quéene found meanes to get the kings conſent: wherby <hi>Gandalin</hi> was no ſooner come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Myre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur but he took him aſide, &amp; ſaid vnto him: <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the quéene is deſirous to haue you ſtay with vs, not only for the loue ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth I beare vnto you, but alſo for the good ſhée wiſheth you. And for this cauſe ſhe would haue you marry with the gentlewoman of Denmarke, whome ſhe loueth, &amp; will doe much both for her &amp; you, if you conſent thereto: you know her long time ſince both to be wiſe, good, &amp; vertuous, and for my part I pray you and counſell you thereunto. <hi>Gandalin</hi> would gladly haue excuſed himſelfe, and to ſay the truth, he was too yong for ſo old a match: neuertheleſſe hauing from his infancie learned to confirme his will to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> he was content to doe as pleaſed him: in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in leſſe than thrée daies after the marriage was celebrated and ended. Meane time king <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke the letters and inſtructions that <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſhould carry to <hi>Gaſquillan</hi> and king <hi>Bruneau,</hi> and ſent them by a gentleman of his named <hi>Handro,</hi> couſin german to the Counteſſe of Flaunders, deſiring them as much as poſſible they might to aide his ſonne in his ſo good a cauſe: but the next weeke following <hi>Gandalin</hi> more affected to the ſeruice of <hi>Eſplandian</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to court his wife, departed from thence to trauaile into Fraunce vnto king <hi>Perion,</hi> and from him to Sobradiſe to <hi>Galaor.</hi> Meane time king <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent for all the pilots, maſters, and mariners of his countrey that he could find, commending king <hi>Arban</hi> of Norgales, to take care for all things requiſite for the enterpriſe &amp; charges of ſuch a vſage, both for men and veſſels. In this maner did the affaires touching theſe wars procéed through the greateſt part of Europe, while all the kings in the Eaſt by little &amp; litle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues togither, as you ſhall heare.</p>

Whereof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour being aduertiſed, cauſed his men to muſter, giuing <hi>Frandalo</hi> charge of the dragon gate, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the foundation of the citty, when it was named Biſance, there was found a maruellous Dragon vnder the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate, which dragon was bound chained, and noriſhed, ſo long time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was thought moſt ſtrange. <hi>Norandel</hi> had charge of the gate called quiline, &amp; <hi>Gaſtiles</hi> his nephew of that called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Well, ſo named of a great &amp; profound well that ſtoode hard by it. And cauſing the other gates to bee rampired vp, prouided for all things as a wiſe &amp; valiant captaine ſhould do in ſuch a caſe. With that a Grecian that had ben take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Turks, came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city, and aſſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Soudan of Liquie was himſelfe in perſon with king <hi>Armato,</hi> and almoſt all the kings of the eaſt, hauing two hundred Gallies, as well great as ſmall, fifty great ſhips, thirty mahoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:191458:119"/> barkes, galions and ſciffes, wherein they had laid their victuals &amp; other munitions: and for their number of footmen, they might be about ſome thrée hundred and fifty thouſand men, ſaying likewiſe, that <hi>Alphorax</hi> had the chéefe charge at ſea, and <hi>Armato</hi> on land, and that their determination was neuer to depart from Conſtantinople, till they had deſtroied it, and from thence would go to Rome, &amp; further if they rould. The ſixt day after, this great army (paſſing the gulfe of Propontide) came into the ſtraights of Conſtantinople, entering in the great ſea, where they remained during the ſiege, robbing all the countrey about, where firſt they ſtaied a wéeke before they landed any of their men: meane time, certain gallies and ſmall ſhips ſet forward to make an alarum in the hauen, from whence (to their great loſſe) they were repulſed, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixe of the principalleſt of them were ſunk in the ſea. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, the next day following they began to land, &amp; in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thought to win the gate: there were many braue blows both with ſword and ſpeare giuen on both parts, and many a valiant man ended their daies, &amp; became meat to fiſhes. There y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights of great Brittain ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues not to bée vnacquainted with ſuch dangers, &amp; who ſo had beheld <hi>Norandel, Frandalo, Manely,</hi> &amp; <hi>Talanque</hi> repulſe the enemy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thought to aduaunce themſelues, might eaſtly iudge with what deſire they fought. But what ſhuld I ſtand longer to deſcribe this conflict? To conclude, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate was defended, &amp; the enemies repulſed from the ſame, yet their number was ſo great, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> notwithſtanding the valour of the Emperours men, they landed &amp; lay within two bowes ſhot of the city, they of the city being forced to retire. The Pagans being on land, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues into four parts, in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the city was ſo well beſieged, that not a man could enter or come forth without their leaue. Wherefore king <hi>Armato</hi> preſently cauſed great number of ladders to bee prepared, the moſt part of them double, hoping before the wéeke were ended, to aſſault, take, ſpoile, and deſtroye the City. But they within ſlept neither night nor day, but made artificiall fires, with all other things requiſite for ſuch a charge. The Pagans ſtaied not long to execute their purpoſe, ſo that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a munday in the morning, they came in great fury to ſet fire
<pb facs="tcp:191458:119"/> on the gates, and to ſcale the Town although for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time they loſt their labors, &amp; many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their liues, where in the end they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to retire to their no litle ſhame &amp; great confuſion. And in their retraict, <hi>Norandel</hi> with four or fiue hundred men, iſſued at a poſtern gate, &amp; ſet vpon them behind, which put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch fear, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they draue them to their tents. Yet not being content with this firſt repulſe they determined on friday after either to die, or enter into the town. And the day appointed, ran vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wals, where the number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſailants was ſo great, &amp; the aſſault giuen in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places both by ſea &amp; land, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if God had not prouided for them, it is moſt certain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town had ben take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: eſpecially on <hi>Frandalos</hi> ſide, for the moſt part of his men fled away from their guard: wherby it happened, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more then a hundred Turks mounted on the wals, but they ſtaied not long, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the emperor (who during the aſſault ſtaied in the midſt of the city with the reſt of all his power to aid ſuch places as had moſt néed) aduertiſed therof, marched to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalos</hi> quarter, and with ſuch force repulſed the enemy, that hée made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glad to get them thence, in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they receaued no leſſe loſſe at the ſecond aſſault then at the firſt. It is true, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ten of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights of great Brittain were ſlaine at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conflict, which much gréeued their companions, ſpecially for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of <hi>Ledarin,</hi> of <hi>Feiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> of <hi>Trys,</hi> and <hi>Imoſil</hi> of Burgundy. This ſecond aſſault hauing had ſuch iſſue as you heard before, <hi>Armato</hi> went to counſell with all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other kings and princes to know what they ſhold do, where it was concluded to kéep their tents, and ſo incloſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town: for to get it by aſſault, they knew ful wel they ſhuld but loſe their labors wherfore they ment no more to try y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: but many times made ſkirmiſhes with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citty to their no litle loſſe. Thus they paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a month without doing any thing worthy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rehearſing, till one day among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, a gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belonging to the ſouldan of Liquie came on meſſage to the gate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:191458:120"/> good returne an anſwere: with that ſhée turned her horſe, and rid the ſame way that ſhee came. Which done, <hi>Norandel</hi> opened the letter, the contents whereof are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodrigue</hi> great Soudan of Liquie, friend to the gods, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their enemies, defendor of the Pagan law: to thée that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thy ſelf knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ſerpent, gréeting. Know thou that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of our long voyage by Sea to enter into theſe countries, hath béene in hope to bee reuenged of the outrages that my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Armato</hi> king of Turky hath receiued at the hands of thée and thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, not hauing once offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thée: and although we are moſt ſure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction of the wicked emperor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauoureth thée in thy ſo wicked and damnable enterpriſes, and that before long time be paſt, both hee and his ſhall end their liues by our hands, yet ſhould I be much gréeued, that this miſfortune ſhould happen vnto thée, before I haue prooued my body againſt thine, becauſe of the renowne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſpread of thée throughout the world. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuſe whether thou wilt accept of the combate betwéene vs two alone, of tenne to tenne, a hundred to a hundred, or of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number as thou thinkeſt good. Swearing vnto thée, by all our gods, that thoſe thou ſhalt bring with thée for that cauſe, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no more diſpleaſure then my ſelf, vnleſſe it be by ſuch as are ordained to fight with them, according to the agréement we ſhall make. Wherefore make mée an anſwere worthy ſuch a Knight, that thereby thy honour be not ſtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norandel</hi> hauing read this letter, ſhewed it to his friends, who were all of aduiſe to graunt the Soudan his requeſt. But <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> would determine nothing before hée made the Emperour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, vnder whoſe conduct during the ſiege, he had ſubmitted himſelfe: whereupon hee went to ſpeake with him, and hauing ſhewed him the contents of the letter that hée had receiued in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandians</hi> name, and the counſell of his companions, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour aſked him what hee thought therein. My lord (ſaied hee) if it pleaſed you, that I and nine others which I will chuſe, ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this combate, you ſhal doe vs great fauor. My good friend (ſaid the Emperor) you ſée the eſtate wherein I am, and the time wherein I ought to kéepe, not onely you and others wherein I
<pb facs="tcp:191458:120"/> put my whole affiance, but the meaneſt ſouldiour in this Cittye. Neuertheles, I will ſo much agrée vnto your will, that if you and your companions thinke it good, I am content you do it. My lord (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) both I and they moſt humblye craue it of your grace. Wel then (ſaid the Emperour) If it pleaſeth God, you ſhal win honour thereby, as you haue done before in many as perril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aduentures as this is. <hi>Norandel</hi> thanked the Emperour, and the ſame day cauſed his Knights of great Brittaigne to bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, by whoſe aduiſe there was an Aunſwere fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Soudans letters, the contents whereof doe follow.</p>
               <p>The knights that are ſeruants to Ieſus Chriſt, being at this time with the Emperor of Conſtantinople, for the defence &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Chriſtians name, to thée <hi>Rodrigue</hi> Souldan of Liquie, like gréeting thou haſt ſent vnto the knight of the great ſerpent: a gentlewoman that ſaith ſhee belongeth vnto thée, that hath giuen vs a letter directed vnto him, the contents wherof are in two points. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> complaineſt of the enterpriſes he hath made againſt thine vncle king <hi>Armato:</hi> in the other thou ſheweſt a deſire y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt to proue thy perſon againſt his, or a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber againſt a greater, as he ſhal think it good. But for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knight thou writeſt vnto at this preſent is not here, nor in place wheras he can return thée anſwer, we thought it conuenient in his behalf to ſatiſfie thy requeſt, &amp; to accept the offers thou haſt made vnto him: aſſuring thée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here is the ſon of a king, &amp; nine other knights with him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil fight with thée and as many more of thine, if thou be content therwith: Aduiſe thy ſelf the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herein, &amp; hauing receiued thy anſwere, with ſafe conduict ſafely to go and come, we wil not faile to be in the place where you ſhall appoint.</p>
               <p>This letter ſealed vp, <hi>Norandel</hi> gaue it to one of his ſquires to bear it to the ſoudan, who made him anſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he deſired only to proue his body againſt the knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ſerpent &amp; none other. But (ſaied he) if thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſent you hether haue any deſire to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ten of my knights, they ſhall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ready, being as great gentlemen and of as high a linage as they are. And as touching their ſafe conduict, I wil ſo wel prouide for it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to think wel of me: wherfore return thou vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and let
<pb facs="tcp:191458:121"/> me know their anſwere. With that the ſquire hauing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, went and came ſo often betwéene them, that in the end the combate of ten to ten was fully agréed vpon, and the liſts appoint hard before the Towne: where they the next morning the tenne knights went, whoſe names were as followeth. <hi>Norandel, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate du Val Craintif, Talanque, Manely, Ambor de Galdel, Elian le delibere, Brauor</hi> ſon of <hi>Balan, Trion</hi> couſin germane to Quéene <hi>Briolanie, Imoſil de Burgoigne,</hi> and <hi>Liſtoran</hi> of the ſiluer bridge.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL that night the ten Knights watched in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palleſt church of Conſtantinople, confeſſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and praying vnto God as if they ſhould preſently die: The next day as the ſunne began to appeare, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour accompanied of diuers Noblemen, the Empreſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> Quéene <hi>Minoreſſe,</hi> with diuers other Ladies and Gentlewomen, came vnto them, where they heard maſſe deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that done, they returned vnto the pallace where <hi>Norandel</hi> and his nine companions armed themſelues, the ladies ſeruing them for ſquires, in ſuch ſort, as <hi>Norandel</hi> receaued ſuch fauor at quéen <hi>Minoreſſes</hi> handes, that ſhee found meanes to helpe to buckle on euery péece of his armour one after the other. As ſhee was buſie about him, he found meanes to ſay vnto her: Madame, the honor that you doe me, maketh mee ſo couragious, that this day I hope to make it knowne to thoſe that ſhall beholde vs fight, how much my ſtrength is now increaſed by your meanes. But if it pleaſed you to beſtow ſome fauour vpon me, that I might bear the ſame about my armour, I ſhould account my ſelfe for one of the moſt happy knights liuing on the yearth. My good friend (ſaied ſhe) the moſt precious iewell y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can giue vnto you, is my heart y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company yours, to the end, that being vnited together, they may the better preſerue both your life &amp; mine. And taking a bracelet
<pb facs="tcp:191458:121"/> of gold, that from her infancy ſhe had alwaies kept, ſhee tied it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his right arme. And this circle (ſaied ſhe) being round as you behold it, ſhall without ceaſing bee witneſſe of our loues, ſeruing for a rampart to this army: which (if it pleaſeth God) in defending it ſhal ſo wel defend his maſter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhall return in as good health as I deſire he ſhould. <hi>Norandel</hi> thanked her moſt heartily: mean time <hi>Leonorine</hi> intertained <hi>Talanque, Manely</hi> &amp; the reſt, to whom ſhe ſaid: My friends, I hope the Lord wil ſhew you ſo much grace that the victory ſhall be yours, for the combat you take in hand is not for to defend the honour of a Gentle woman, but the glorious faith of Chriſt. If therfore it be ſo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength procéedeth from him, be you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel aſſured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil impart ſo much to you as you ſhal want. Madame (ſaid <hi>Talanque</hi>) at other times we haue ben at the like feaſt, from whence we haue returned to the great expence of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> called vs thither: as (if it be Gods wil) we hope this day to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. Wherwith taking their leaues of her, they went to find their horſes, and being mounted, the emperor with great number of knights and gentlewomen brought them to the gate: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to God, the ten knights marched brauely to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of combat, where the ſouldan with a great number of his friends met the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſking them whom the emperor had appointed iudge on their ſide. Souldan (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) wée deſire no other iudge then your ſelf, that are accounted a curteous and moſt faithfull prince. By all my gods (ſaid he) I had rather die a thouſand deaths, then you ſhould indure the leaſt iniury in the world: we beléeue it wel (ſaid al the knights. With y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he cauſed them to enter into the liſts at one end, and the ten pagans at the other: but before they entred into fight, he called <hi>Norandel</hi> &amp; his companions, &amp; ſaid vnto them: My friends, I pray you let me ſhew you what the cuſtome of my country is in ſuch affairs: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if you think good, you may obſerue it, if not, my knights ſhal kéep your cuſtome if it be indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Shew vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) what it is, &amp; if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame be reaſonable, we wil not refuſe it. You ſhal vnderſtand (ſaid he) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all knights iuſtle one againſt one, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men may know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellency of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: And if any one be ouerthrown, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is on horſeback ſhall not aſſaile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before their companions haue run out their courſe:
<pb facs="tcp:191458:122"/> Then he that is on horſeback ſhall alight, and ſhall fight it out by dint of ſword with him that before was ouerthrown. Becauſe it chanceth oftentimes, that the beſt knights that are fall into ſuch inconuenience, only by the fault and means of bad horſes, which cauſe them diuers times either to faile in ſtriking of their enemy, or els not to run their right courſe: Which cannot bee excuſed in thoſe that are on foot, to whome it is permitted to ſuccour each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if néed require. Truly (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) that cuſtome is wel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and I and my companions will obſerue the ſame. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſoudan went out of the liſts, cauſing his Heralds to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the fight: With that a Pagan ſtepped forth againſt <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> that refuſed him not: but couering himſelfe with his ſhield, they met ſo fiercely, that their ſpears were broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their wreſts, méeting body to body with ſo great ſtrength, that the Pagan fell ouer his horſe taile, lying flat vpon the ground: but <hi>Norandel</hi> had no hurt, onely that his horſes ſhoulder was thruſt out of ioint, ſo that he lighted of, ſtaying til the reſt had runne their courſe, as he had promiſed. Then <hi>Garuate du Val Craintif</hi> ran againſt one of the other, and they charged each other in ſuch ſort, that their féet failing in their ſtirrops, they were both caſt out of their ſaddles. Then <hi>Talanque</hi> ran againſt the third Pagan, to whome fortune was more fauourable then to any of the reſt: for they ran ſo wel, that neither of them once ſtarted aſide, or moued in their ſaddles, and yet brake their ſpeares in many péeces. The like chanced to <hi>Manely</hi> and <hi>Ambor,</hi> but not to <hi>Brauor</hi> the ſon of <hi>Balan,</hi> for hee hit him that ran againſt him right in the breaſt, and threw him from his horſe. And preſently therewith <hi>Imoſil</hi> of Burgundy had ſo great a ſtroke with a launce, that his eies ſtarted in his head, and was therewith ſo much aſtoniſhed, that his horſe bare him to the ſide of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rriers, where he fell downe flat. <hi>Elian le delibere,</hi> and hee that ran againſt him, were conſtrained to holde by their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes maines. <hi>Liſtoran</hi> of the ſiluer bridge miſſed his ſtroke, and his enemy likewiſe: the like happened to <hi>Trion,</hi> and the laſt that ran with him. That done, all they that were on horſebacke, lighted downe to fight with ſwords, and there began betwéen them ſuch a fight as the like had not béene ſéene of ſo few knights together,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:122"/> maintaining themſelues ſo brauely one againſt the other, that the ſtrongeſt of them was ſo wearie and out of breath, that they were conſtrained to reſt. And as <hi>Norandel</hi> leaned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſword which he reſted on the ground, the bracelet that <hi>Minoreſſe</hi> gaue him fell downward vpon his arme, which put him in ſo good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of her, that cleane forgetting all the trauaile hée he had taken before, he ſpake ſo loud that euery man might hear, and ſaid: By God, ſir Knight, this reſt doth not beſéeme vs: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men will from henceforth be in doubt of the great glory that now we meane to win. Wherefore let euery man ſhewe forth what he can doe, and let no man ſpare. Wherewith taking the little péece of his ſhield that reſted in his hand, and lifting vp his arme, he gaue ſo great a blow vnto his enemie, that he made him réele therewith: and doubling it, ſtrake him ſo ſurely on the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, that with the blow the Turke was forced to knéele downe, and let his ſword fall out of his hand: which <hi>Norandel</hi> ſeaſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being readie to ſtrike off his head, if he had not cried him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: which <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manely</hi> perceiuing, employed their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſuch manner, that it might eaſily be iudged they would ſoon obtaine the victorie. As for <hi>Brauor</hi> he had alreadie ſtricken his knight downe, wherefore he ranne to helpe the reſt, and <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> likewiſe. With the which helpe it ſoone appeared, that they which reſted yet to ouercome would not long reſiſt: for in ſhort ſpace they found themſelues in ſuch extremitie, that vnleſſe the Souldan of Liquie had deſired the Chriſtian knights to ſtay a while, they had all died: but calling <hi>Norandel</hi> vnto him, he ſaid: I pray you (ſaid he) procéed no further in this combat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelues that I account my knights for vanquiſhed, as in truth they are, and ſo hardly handled, that the force you ſhall from henceforth vſe againſt them, ſhall more be holden for a kinde of crueltie than any chiualrie. Neuertheles if my requeſt may take no place with you doe as you thinke good. Souldan (ſaid <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>) if they acknowledge it at our hands and aſke vs mercie, they ſhall not faile to haue it: for it was neuer our cuſtome to vſe force to ſuch as could not ſtand againſt vs. Content your ſelues (ſaide he) that I that am their Lord yéeld you the victorie, and I pray
<pb facs="tcp:191458:123"/> you therefore ſhew mercie vnto them, ſwearing vnto you by my crowne (if you doe them ſo much good) that while I liue, I will not be vnmindfull of the ſame.

To come vnto the point, this quéene of Califorine being a woman of great ſpirit, valiant, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, young, faire, and of good behauiour, hearing of the warres vndertaken againſt the Chriſtians, was deſirous to be there, not for any ill ſhée wiſhed them, but onely for to know them, and to ſée their countrey that bare ſo great renowme. And for that cauſe ſhe aſſembled great numbers of the principall ladies of her countrey, ſhewing them what honour they might obtaine in that voiage: which may peraduenture be ſuch (ſaid ſhée) that by our force and great proweſſe wée may greatly augment our Empire, béeing feared and redoubted of each man, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue alwaies buried among theſe mountaines, as they in times paſt did, of whome at this preſent wée now poſſeſſe and enioye the place. The Quéene in this ſort could ſo well perſuade them, that they being mooued with a marueilous deſire to goe with her, preſently prepared their ſhippes, and ſet ſaile for Thracia, with ſo good and proſperous a winde, that the tenth day after the aſſaults of Conſtantinople, they arriued in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of <hi>Armato,</hi> where they were honourably receiued: &amp; after
<pb facs="tcp:191458:124"/> diuers ſpéeches vſed by the Souldan of Liquie, and other princes of the campe vnto the quéene of Califorine, ſpecially touching their determination concerning that great enterpriſe, ſhée being ſorrie they had done ſo little againſt the towne, deſired them that ſhe might once haue leaue to try her fortune againſt it, by means that ſhe would vſe. And the better to induce them thereunto, ſhe told them ſhe had fiftie griffons that would not faile (béeing let out of their cages) to ſeaſe vpon the Chriſtians without hurting of her women, becauſe they knewe them and had béen nouriſhed with them. And while they take their flight (ſaid ſhe) I will giue ſuch an aſſault againſt the towne, that without doubt wee will enforce the ſame: for if the Emperors ſouldiers appeare but to defend the wals, my Griffons ſhall be ready to carrie them clean away, as the Merlin doth the larke. But to the end (ſaid ſhe) your men receiue no hurt, let them abide within their tentes till they be ſhut into their cages. When king <hi>Armato</hi> and the Souldan of Liquie heard the great zeale and affection ſhe ſhewed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy her forces, as alſo the inuention that ſhe had, they all agréed that the next day after ſhe ſhould doe what liked her. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſent preſently to her that kept the griffons, that ſhée ſhould giue them nothing for to eate of all that day, that when they meant to vſe them at the aſſault, they might be gréedier: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent worde by ſound of drumme, that all her companies ſhould be readie the next day early in the morning, to giue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault vnto the citie. Quéene <hi>Calafre</hi> hauing in this maner proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for her enterpriſe, at the time appointed all her women ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to their manner (the moſt part of them bearing bowes) ranne with great furie vnto the walles, and with their ladders began to mount vp: with that the alarme went about the citie, all men running to defend the ſame: and as they were ſome vpon the walles and other places of defence, the Quéene made ſigne to let the Griffons looſe, which being hungry and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer the towne, ſeazed vpon ſuch as they could find abroad: wherewith the Emperours ſouldiers were in ſo great feare, that moſt part of them that fought, forſooke the walles to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Alas what pitie was it to ſée ſouldiers, citizens, knights,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:124"/> and others, yea women and little children, and all whatſoeuer they could get into their clawes taken vp into the aire, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hauing taken them vp, they let them fall vpon the ſtones, whereby they had a ſtrange and cruell death: ſurely if God had not kept the Cittie better than thoſe that had the charge, it is moſt ſure it had béene taken at that time. But there happened a ſtrange caſe, for as the Griffons helde their prey, and that the Knights of great Brittaine with ſome ſmall number of others, reſiſted the aſſault made by the women, the Turkes (that had béen aduertiſed not to come out of their tents while they aſſailed the towne) mooued with too gréedy a deſire to ſacke the Citte which they thought ſurely had béen taken, ranne vnto the aſſault making ſuch a noiſe, that the Griffons (féeding on their preyes) left the bodies they had ſeazed vpon, and flying vp againe, ſeaſed on them that they ſawe come running to the towne, whereof in ſhort ſpace after they made ſo great a butcherie, that more than foure hundred Turkes were preſently ſlaine by them: meane time thoſe within the towne perceiuing that good fortune, did ſo fiercely repulſe the Californiens, that their principall women lay dead within the ditches: wherewith the Quéene was forced to retire, knowing her enterpriſe would not take effect as ſhée deſired it ſhould, not by reaſon of her ſouldiers, but in that they kept not in as they had promiſed. Wherewith ſhe commanded to take the birdes againe, but the Falconers could not by any meanes make them to come in, before they had ſlaine and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue a thouſand Turkes and others, whereof they onely ſuckt the blood. Wherewith king <hi>Armato</hi> and the Souldan of Liquie were ſo grieued, that from thenceforth they began to ſhew ſo hard a countenance to the Quéene, that ſhée was in the minde to returne into her countrey, not offering from that time once to giue ſtroke with ſword to their aduantage. Yet not long after ſhée was appeaſed, and fought with King <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> as it ſhall bée ſhewed you at large in the end of this our fift Booke. And that wée may haue the better meanes to attaine thereto, wée will now returne againe vnto the Chriſtian Princes, that aſſembled their powers and forces to helpe the

But before they arriued at Conſtantinople, many good knights both of great Brittaine and others were ſlaine within the citie, not onely in the aſſaultes made againſt it by the Pagans, but at the laſt aſſault made by the quéene <hi>Calafre,</hi> among the which, none were ſo much lamented as <hi>Ledarin de Faiarque, Trys, Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill</hi> of Burgundie, and the two ſonnes of the gyant <hi>Balan.</hi>

So well could <hi>Gandalin</hi> tell his tale, that the good old king <hi>Perion</hi> mooued with a holy zeale, determined to go himſelfe in perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:125"/> and to take with him great quantity of ſhips and men, furniſhed for the wars. <hi>Gandalin</hi> ſtayed not long with him, but while hee prepared himſelfe, hee went into Scotland, Norway, Sobradiſe, Denmarke and Sweathland, and did his Embaſſages ſo well, that all the Kings and Princes to whome hee went, determined with all ſpéede to aid <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that in ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſhips were ready, and thoſe of Sweathland, Norway, and Denmarke, come vnto the port of Suer, from whence ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſaile, they coaſted along Freſeland, Holland, and Braband, till they arriued at Bulloigne, where king <hi>Perion</hi> had prepared great number of Ships, Hulkes, and other veſſels: which being furniſhed with men, victuals, and munition neceſſarye for the warres, hoiſed ſaile and put to ſea.

But if the Pagans at the firſt were much abaſhed to ſée thoſe ſuccours, the Emperor &amp; thoſe within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town were not much leſſe, doubting it had béen ſome new forces come againſt the towne: for they had not any intelligence of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Gandalin</hi> &amp; <hi>Enil</hi> to the chriſtian princes, that brought with them a multitude both of ſhips &amp; men, as well knights as others.

Gentlewoman (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) if you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our camp only to ſée him, you now haue your deſire. That hath not ben only the cauſe (ſaid ſhe) but to bring this letter which the Souldan of Liquie and Quéen <hi>Calafre</hi> ſend vnto you both: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing read it, I pray you returne an anſwere. With that (<hi>Amadis</hi> hauing taken it in his hand) the Gentlewoman depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the tent, attending their reſolution. King <hi>Amadis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read it, ſhewed it to King <hi>Luiſart</hi> and the reſt that were in preſence, wherewith there roſe great controuerſie among them concerning the refuſall or acceptation of the combat, for that the moſt part of them were of aduiſe it ſhould not be accepted, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuers great and euident reaſons to confirm the ſame, as the greater number of enemies they had before them readye to giue them battaile, &amp; if it happen (ſaid they) that fortune ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to king <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> (in whome partly conſiſteth our hope) ſuch hard chance would bréed great fear in diuers men
<pb facs="tcp:191458:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> that are now very willing &amp; ready to do the beſt they can. Others held the contrary, ſaying that it would be ſhame vnto them al, for that that refuſal only would much incourage the enemy, but they were of this opinion, that it might wel be required that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the combatants might be greater. In good truth (ſaie <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>) be it of two againſt two, twenty againſt twenty, or of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, the victory is in the hands of God. Wherefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing thereof, I ſhould doe my ſelfe wrong, and cauſe a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to all Chriſtendome, that would not be defaced in long time after. Beſides I haue great hope of Gods helpe herein, for whoſe faith and honour I haue vndertaken this voiage. When <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> heard his fathers mind, he ſpake boldlier and ſaid: That he would take that combate vpon himſelfe alone, not onely againſt the Souldan and the Quéene, but againſt two others more with them, rather then it ſo ſhould be refuſed: whereupon it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>Amadis</hi> and he would fight, and ſending for the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger into the tent, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaied vnto her: Gentlewoman, you ſhall tel the Souldan and the Quéene that I and my ſon are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doe as they require, wherefore let them chuſe what arms they will, and for the place it ſhall bee betwéene their campe and ours: aſſuring them on the faith of a king, that not one of our ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours ſhall once remoue, how ſoeuer we ſpéed, which wee deſire likewiſe at their hands: and if it bée their deſire to haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate fought this day, we are content to doe it. With that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman returned, and comming to the Souldans tent, ſhée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her meſſage vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being ſuch as you haue heard: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Souldan was glad, but eſpecially the Quéene, for the great deſire ſhe had to ſée <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> wherefore ſhee aſked the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman what ſhe thought of him. Madame (ſaied ſhee) I haue in my life time ſéene many men and women that nature had indued with great beautie, but by the gods I confeſſe it is all but pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in regard of that I haue found in him: for hee is ſo faire and beautifull, that the more I thinke thereon, ſo much the more it maketh me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue ſuch beauty to be rather deuine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humane. That is much (ſaid the Quéene.) I know not (ſaid the gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) what you meane by that word Much, but I am wel aſſured,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:129"/> if you had ſéene him as I did, that you would ſay as much as I doe, and it may be more. Truly (ſaied the Quéene) before I enter in combat with him, I will firſt ſée him vnarmed, and ſpeak with him, not as an enemie to an enemy, but as friends commonly do one vnto the other. Madame (ſaied the Souldan) ſéeing it is your deſire, it were good our Gentlewoman went againe vnto them, to deſire them to giue you leaue to come and viſite them in their campe, not to procure them any cauſe of enuy, but to do them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and for that cauſe to deſire their ſafe conduct. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſéemed good vnto the Quéene, and without longer ſtaying ſhe ſent the Gentlewoman backe againe vnto <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> whom ſhe found yet in the Tent whereas ſhe left them. With that ſhe told them what her meſſage was, and the great deſire the Quéene had to ſée them before they entred into combat. King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> could not refraine laughing to hear the Gentlewoman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the affection her miſtreſſe had, aſking king <hi>Luiſart</hi> what he thought therein. Sonne (ſaied hee) deny not her requeſt, for I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you (ſince our comming hether) I haue heard the Quéene to bée eſtéemed a wiſe and beautifull Princeſſe. You heare our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere (ſaied <hi>Amadis</hi> to the Gentlewoman) let the Quéene come hether when ſhe thinketh good, for ſhe ſhall be heartely welcome. With that the Gentlewoman returned to the Quéene, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly pleaſed with that anſwere, determined the next daye to goe vnto them. But ſhe knew not well what manner of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſhe were beſt to weare: ſometimes ſhee thought it fit to goe as ſhe vſed when ſhe went to bataile, and then preſently changed opinion, thinking a womans apparrell would bee more ſéemely and conuenient, ſéeing ſhe went not to trie their forces, but only to win the loue and fauour of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> if ſhe might procure the ſame. And thinking on it all night long, in the morning when ſhe meant to apparrell her ſelf, ſhe was reſolued to dreſſe her as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vſe to do, thinking ſhe had means inough afterward to ſhew her ſelfe in habite of a knight, whereby ſhee might bee ſéene both in the one and the other ſort. Whervpon ſhe cauſed her moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious robes to be brought vnto her, and apparrelling her ſelf, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not any thing that might once beautifie or adorn her perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:191458:129"/> or that in her opinion would deck her well, the better to be liked. And to bear her company ſhe tooke twelue of her own gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo well furniſhed and ſet forth with ſtones and pearles, that the like was neuer ſéene. That done, ſhe ſent vnto her ſhips for a moſt ſtrange and monſtrous beaſt, wherevpon ſometimes ſhee vſed to ride in great pomp. It was as big as a great Dromadary, the hair long &amp; ſomewhat yellow, black ſpots, his two eares han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging downe vnto his knées, hauing but one eye, ſhining brighter then a burning glaſſe, and ſtood right in the midſt of his forehead: out of his mouth there iſſued two great téeth like hornes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his féet were clouen like an ox, yet was there no Hart in all the world y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could outrun him, were it in plaine way, or ouer rockes. In that manner ſhe entered into the Chriſtans campe, of whom ſhe was not a little wondred at before ſhee came to King <hi>Luiſarts</hi> tent, where <hi>Amadis</hi> and in a maner all the principal cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the army ſtaied for her, praying <hi>Quedragant</hi> to goe out to welcome her, which he did with great courteſie: for he had no ſooner eſpied her, but hee ſtepped forward, and doing her great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, holpe her to diſcend, and taking her by the arme, led her into the tent, where the lords were all aſſembled, of whome ſhee was moſt honourably receiued. But when ſhe beheld <hi>Eſplandians</hi> beauty, ſhe was ſo much ſurpriſed with the loue of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented her comming thether, not ſo much for the ſmall hope ſhee had to win him, (being diuers in religion) but doubting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy newly entred into hir mind would ſo much eſtrange hir force (by ouermuch thinking vpon him) when ſhe went to fight, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe ſhould be in danger to loſe the honour and reputation ſhee had gotten in arms among the beſt knights in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: which to preuent, ſhee determined to ſtay the leſſe time there, knowing the nature of loue to bee ſuch, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it can ſteale the hearts of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and commonly maketh himſelfe poſſeſſor of it, before hee that hath it in poſſeſſion, can perceaue it. And as the Princes entertained her with diuers ſwéete and pleaſant ſpéeches, ſhee tourned to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and ſaied: Sir Knight, for two moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces that are in you, I haue taken the paines to
<pb facs="tcp:191458:130"/> come and viſite you: The firſt is the gift of beauty, which is ſuch in you, as I could neuer haue imagined the ſame: The other is the force of your body and magnanimity of your courage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you are accounted altogether inuincible. The one I haue ſéen with mine eies to be ſo perfect, that I neuer hope to ſée the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, although I liued a thouſand yeares and more: the other, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> combat you ſhal haue againſt the moſt puiſſant Souldan of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie will be a witneſſe vnto vs: and had it not ben that hée reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted me to fight againſt king <hi>Amadis</hi> (becauſe his onely deſire is to prooue his body againſt yours) I would haue tried it my ſelfe. Of one thing can I wel aſſure you, that if the honour remaine to vs and life to you, I will afterward tel you a thing that much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth me, and which I greatly deſire to let you know before I ſaile into my countrey. Now for this time I haue ſatiſfied my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: wherefore my lords (ſaid ſhe vnto all the Princes) I beſéech you pardon me in not vſing longer ſpéeches, for I know full well that my long ſtaying with you, (thinking to finde that I hoped for) might poſſible cauſe me to loſe my ſelfe, wherewith I ſhould be ouermuch diſpleaſed, for that before ſunneſetting I hope to bée in place where I will ſhew ſuch valour in armes, that hee which neuer could be vanquiſhed by man (as it is reported) ſhal now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an ouerthrow at a ſimple womans hand. Madame (ſaied king <hi>Perion</hi>) fortune can doe much when it pleaſeth her, if you do as you ſay, truly you ſhall doe more then we can well beléeue, but commonly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workman is known by his worke, and becauſe the iſſue of the combat is the glory of him or you, til then we wil defer our iudgements. And although <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiued himſelfe much outraged by the quéen, yet he made no ſign thereof, but taking her by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arm, led her where her company ſtaied, and as ſhée mounted to return, with a ſmiling countenance he ſpake vnto her and ſaid: Madame, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come to dealing of blowes I beſéech you ſhew me not the greateſt extremity you can, becauſe I was alwaies a friend to women, and euer will be during my life: wherevnto the quéen anſwered not a word, but rode vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pagans camp to arm hir ſelfe. Mean time <hi>Brian de Moniaſte</hi> arriued in the Chriſtians camp, who hauing ben ſent by the king of Spain his father with
<pb facs="tcp:191458:130"/> a great power of men into Africa, to beſiege the town of Ceſonie after called Centie, was aduertiſed by a pirate, of the Chriſtians enterpriſe, and how their army and great fléet had paſſed the cape of <hi>Finis terre,</hi> preſently ſent vnto his father to deſire him to giue him leaue to goe that voiage: whereunto by much importunitie he granted. For which cauſe <hi>Brian</hi> brake vp his ſiege of Cente, and entring again into his ſhips ſailed to Cicile, and from thence to Galipoli, and ſo to Conſtantinople, where he ioyned with the Chriſtian princes that receiued him moſt gladly.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Q</seg>Véene <hi>Calafre</hi> returned to the Pagans campe as you heard before, preſently armed her ſelfe, &amp; the Souldan like wiſe, and ſtayed not long before they came vnto the place where the combat was aſſigned, where not long after they found <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian:</hi> and becauſe the two campes were not well aſſured of each other (notwithſtanding the oathes and promiſes on both ſides made) they ſet themſelues in order of battaile not ſtirring one foot: king <hi>Perion</hi> ſending word to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> and king <hi>Childadan,</hi> that as they had intelligence from the enemy, they ſhould ſet vpon their armie by ſea: the like word was ſent vnto the Emperour of Conſtantinople, that he might likewiſe be prepared: and as the foure combatants were ready to ſtrike each other, the Souldan called <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> aſking them if they would not ſweare and kéepe promiſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the agréement ſent vnto them by his gentlewoman) that the vanquiſhers without impeachment ſhould lead away the vanquiſhed. I truly, ſaid they, therefore beware of vs. With that <hi>Amadis</hi> made towards the Quéene, and the Souldan againſt <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:191458:131"/> to whome he gaue ſo great a blow with his launce into the ſhield, that he pierced it through: wherby diuers thought aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly he had béen wounded to death, but it was not ſo, for the launce paſſed vnder his ſaddle without any further hurt: but <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> gaue him his exchange, ſtriking him ſo fiercely, that hée made him looſe both ſtirrop and ſaddle and fall vpon the ground, with ſo great might, that he rolled twice or thrice before he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſuch manner, that the helmet flew off his head. Quéene <hi>Calafre</hi> ranne againſt king <hi>Amadis,</hi> and he againſt her: and as they were in the middle of their courſe, <hi>Amadis</hi> turned the but end of his launce againſt her, &amp; paſſing forward would not ſtrike her: yet ſhée held her launce downe and ſtrake his horſe in the ſtéele of his forehead, and withall they met ſo ſtrongly body to body, that therewith the Quéene fell downe, &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to light, his horſe was ſo aſtoniſhed with the truncheon of the launce that ſtucke within his forehead. But the Quéene roſe preſently, and with her ſword in hand went towards <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> the like did the Souldan to <hi>Eſplandian</hi> that had ſuffered him to take breath and lace his helmet, not for any good he wiſhed him, but that at the end of his carere hée eſpied the princes <hi>Leonorine</hi> ſtanding on the walles of Conſtantinople, whereat he was ſo abaſhed, that euery man ſaide, the Souldan had hurt him in the bodie. Neuertheleſſe within ſhort ſpace after they knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: for hée lighted on foote, where betwéene them two was fought the moſt perillous combat that euer was ſéene, for <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> was as valiant a knight in armes as any in his time: but <hi>Eſplandian</hi> handled him in ſuch manner, that often times he made him cleane forget the ſubtilties that commonly he vſed in ſuch affaires, and in the end vſed him ſo hardly, that it might euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſéene the victorie would be his. Meane time the Quéene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all her force to ouercome king <hi>Amadis,</hi> who holding in his hand a great truncheon of a launce inſtead of a ſword, gaue her ſuch a blowe on the creſt of her helmet, that hée made her eyes ſtart within her head. Wherewith ſhée being much offended, ſpake vnto him, and ſaid: What ſir Knight? doe you thinke me either to he a dogge or elſe a countrey clowne, that you ſéeme to
<pb facs="tcp:191458:131"/> beat me with a ſtaffe? By my head before you eſcape out of my handes, there is no armour you haue but will be néedfull for you to the ſafegard of your life. <hi>Calafre</hi> (ſaid <hi>Amadis</hi>) all my life time I haue béene a ſeruant vnto Ladies, and if at this time I ſhould begin with you to wiſh them ill, the good that others haue receiued at my handes would be leſſe eſtéemed. You account mée then (ſaid the Quéene) one of that number: but you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently féele that I am ſomething more: with that ſhée tooke her ſword in both handes, and in great choller gaue him ſuch a blow, that ſhée claue his ſhield in two, and thinking to double her ſtroke, <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtepped vnto her and plucked hers from off her necke, with ſuch force, that ſhée was conſtrained to knéele vpon the ground. Neuertheleſſe ſhée roſe preſently againe, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be reuenged, vſed all her force to charge <hi>Amadis,</hi> who turning aſide gaue her ſuch a blowe with his truncheon hard by the eare, and therewith made her ſo aſtoniſhed, that her ſworde fell out of her hand: wherewith he ſtepped forward, and taking her by the helmet, ſaid vnto her: Now you ſhall be my priſoner whether you will or not, as well as the Souldan is priſoner to my ſonne. With that the Quéene looked aſide and perceiued that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſaid true: wherefore ſhée ſaid: Truly I am your priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſéeing fortune will haue it ſo: and therewith <hi>Rodrigue</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> came vnto them, and they foure going out of the liſts, went vnto the Chriſtians campe: the Pagans that ſaw them ledde away in whome in a manner conſiſted moſt of their hope, when the campes ſhould ioyne in battaile, made countenance to reſcue them: which cauſed the Chriſtians to ſtand all day in order of battaile: meane time they agréed among themſelues to ſend the Souldan and the Quéene vnto Conſtantinople, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> hauing charge to bring them thither, and preſent them to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorine,</hi> from <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them moſt heartily. And before hée returned againe vnto the campe, a ſouldier of Thrace (that had dwelt in Tartaria aboue twentie yéere togither) came and yéelded himſelfe vnto the Chriſtians, and tolde King <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Luiſart,</hi> that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies determined the next day in the morning to ſurpriſe them
<pb facs="tcp:191458:132"/> before they were aware, whereof they aduertiſed the Emperor of Conſtantinople, to the end he might be readie. There were in the citie fortie thouſand men, whereof he appointed thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to iſſue forth vpon the enemies rereward, as ſoone as they perceiued the battaile once begon, and gaue likewiſe intelligence to King <hi>Childadan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> that his ſpies had brought him newes that <hi>Alphorax</hi> had vnfurniſhed his ſhippes of men to ſtrengthen their armie on land, truſting to the ſtraights which they meane to kéepe, hoping thereby to ſaile into the Maiorque ſeas, if fortune fauour not their enterpriſe: and there it would be good (with the other Chriſtian princes aduiſe) that they ſhould ſet vpon him, and that <hi>Frandalo</hi> with his fléete ſhould ſecond them. Which newes vnderſtood by the two Generals of the armie by ſea, they ſent vnto king <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt of the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the campe, to knowe their aduiſe: whereunto anſwer was returned, that they ſhould followe the opinion of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conſtantinople, which they ſhould execute vpon the next day in the morning: wherevpon <hi>Frandalo</hi> ceaſed not all night to make and prepare diuers kindes of artificiall fires, wherewith he made account to burne the moſt part of <hi>Alphorax</hi> ſhips, which he did, as hereafter you ſhall heare. But to returne to king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi> and his forces: About an houre before day, according to their former determinations, they began to march againſt the Chriſtians, thinking to find them ſléeping, and thereby to ſlay their watch before they ſhould haue meanes to ſet themſelues in order of battaile. Neuertheleſſe they found themſelues deceiued, for they were alreadie ſet in order of battaile, ſtanding cloſe, with great deſire to receiue their enemie as they did: the Emperour of Rome had the vantguard, and with him king <hi>Luiſart:</hi> king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> king <hi>Perion, Galaor,</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> the maine battaile: &amp; <hi>Floreſtan, Bruneo,</hi> and <hi>Balan,</hi> the rereguard. On the Pagans ſide there marched firſt, the Souldan of Alaxa, thréeſcore knightes, two Califfes, and foure Tamorlanes, that in great furie ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperour of Rome and his battaile: where at their firſt arriuall many a braue knight was ſtroken downe, both on the one ſide and the other, for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and the Chriſtian princes
<pb facs="tcp:191458:132"/> being fayned togither, gaue not one blowe but it was a deadly ſtroke: yet at the firſt they were repulſed by the great quantitie of arrowes the enemies ſhot againſt them, which flew in ſo great number, that haileſtones neuer fell thicker out of the ſkies: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it fell out, that both vantguard, maine battaile, and reregard, indured much paine: with that <hi>Norandel, Talanque, Manely, Trion, Landin, Licoran, Imoſill, Palomie, Enil, Ellan,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all <hi>Eſplandians</hi> companions with thirtie thouſand men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Emperour, iſſued out of the citie: which ſmall troupe (reſolutely determined) did ſo abaſh the Pagans, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they all loſt their courages: whereby they preſently began to recule as farre backe as they aduanced themſelues: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thoſe that before had béen in feare tooke courage againe, and turning their faces on the enemie, recouered the ground that they had loſt, in ſuch ſort, that with good cauſe they might well crie, Victorie. On the other ſide, <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Childadan</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſaile, made towardes the ſtraights, at the entrie whereof <hi>Frandalo</hi> ouertooke them with foureſcore veſſels of all ſorts: and as they had ſpoken togither touching their enterpriſe (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great power of their enemies) it was agréed that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo</hi> (that had prooued them at other times) ſhould firſt ſet vpon them: wherwith he began to ſaile forwards, and <hi>Alphorax</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe againſt him, giuing a ſigne of battaile to his men, who with great courage entred vpon ten of the beſt gallies that the Chriſtians had and ſunke them in the ſea: yet <hi>Frandalo</hi> nought abaſhed, ſet fire on more than an hundred of their ſhippes before <hi>Childadan</hi> entred into fight: but not long after, hée and <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> came vnto them, where good defence preuailed. In which fight they continued for the ſpace of eight houres without any ſigne vpon which ſide the victorie would fall vntill <hi>Quedragant</hi> borded <hi>Alphorax</hi> ſhippe and entred by force, ſlaying all that were therein. What néed I ſtand longer to diſcourſe?
